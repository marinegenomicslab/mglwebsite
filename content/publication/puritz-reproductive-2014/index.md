abstract: Spawning patterns and reproductive variance of Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion
  nebulosus dams and sires at two restoration enhancement facilities in Texas were
  assessed across a spawning year by using parentage analysis based on 12 variable
  microsatellite loci. In total, 72.6% of all dams and sires contributed to at least
  one spawning event, although in contrasting patterns. Across all spawning events
  assayed, more sires contributed to each spawn, on average, than did dams; dams had
  considerably higher variance in reproductive success than sires. Dams alternatively
  had a higher average contribution to the number of progeny from a single spawn but
  also a much higher variance in the number of progeny produced per spawn. The variation
  in the number of progeny produced per dam and per sire and the number of actual
  mating combinations led to an average reduction of 64.3% in the genetic effective
  population size (Ne) per spawn relative to the maximum Ne that would be expected
  if (1) all possible dam × sire mating combinations occurred at random and (2) all
  families contained an equal number of progeny. Averaged over all spawns, the actual
  number of mating combinations accounted for approximately 83.6% of the total reduction
  in Ne, while variation in family size accounted for 16.4% of the total reduction
  in Ne. Results from this and other studies indicate that reductions in Ne of hatchery-
  or farm-raised progeny stem primarily from noncontributing dams, suggesting that
  periodic identiﬁcation and removal of low-contributing dams from broodﬁsh stocks
  constitute a critical step toward maximizing the Ne of hatchery offspring used in
  restoration enhancement.
