abstract: 'Genetic polyandry was assessed in 27 litters of Blacknose Shark (*Carcharhinus acronotus*) from genetically distinct populations in the U.S. Atlantic (19 litters) and eastern Gulf of Mexico (eight litters) using 23 polymorphic
  microsatellite loci. Two methods were used to estimate genetic polyandry, and the overall observed rates were high
  (74% COLONY2; 81% allele counting method), with a maximum of four sires detected in a single litter. When separated
  by region, the rate of genetic polyandry was 63% (COLONY2) or 74% (allele counting method) in the U.S. Atlantic, and
  100% (both methods) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Data were resampled to evaluate how the number and diversity of
  markers analyzed affected the estimated rate of genetic polyandry. The number of alleles per locus had a dramatic
  effect on the detection of polyandry, with a difference of 56% in the estimated rate of genetic polyandry (22% vs.
  78%), when using only the five loci with the highest diversity (A ¼ 21–44) versus lowest diversity (A ¼ 3–5). The total
  number of markers assessed also affected the estimated rate of genetic polyandry, and the estimated rate increased by
  13% when using 10 versus 20 loci (66% vs. 79%, respectively). These results suggest that unless loci are highly
  polymorphic, relatively large numbers of loci are required to estimate the rate of genetic polyandry accurately in
  elasmobranchs, particularly those with small litter sizes like the Blacknose Shark.'
