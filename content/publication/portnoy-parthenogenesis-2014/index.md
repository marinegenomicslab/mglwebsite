abstract: Genetic analysis of a female whitetip reef shark textitTriaenodon obesus
  and her stillborn pup, assumed to be of parthenogenetic origin, revealed that the
  pup was homozygous at all 24 nuclear‚Äêencoded microsatellites assayed, consistent
  with the idea that diploidy in the pup had been restored via terminal fusion. Flow
  cytometric analysis, however, indicated that the genome size of the pup was no more
  than half that of the mother, and microscopy revealed that nuclear volume was c.
  1.73 times larger in the mother than in the pup. Together these data suggest that
  the pup was genetically haploid, developing directly from an unfertilized egg; as
  far as is known, this is the first observation of a spontaneously produced haploid
  vertebrate.
