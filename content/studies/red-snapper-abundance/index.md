title: Estimating Atlantic red snapper population size with genetic close-kin mark-recapture

abstract: Red snapper, *Lutjanus campechanus*, is an ecologically and economically significant reef fish in US Atlantic waters between North Carolina and south Florida, where it has been estimated to be overfished since the early 1970s. Restrictive management of the fishery has caused vocal dissent among various user groups driving a need for a more in-depth population assessment. Using two methods to estimate the population size independent of the stock assessment we hope to benefit future fisheries management decisions. The first method (carried out by colleagues at UF and NC State) will use a hierarchical Bayesian integrated abundance model to produce an estimate of age-2+ red snapper population size in the study region based on SERFS trap-camera and ROV survey data. For the second method we are developing a genotyping in thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel of 400 loci to genotype individuals for close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR). Genotyping will be carried out on over 6,000 individuals each year to identify half-siblings and population size will be estimated from this number using a red snapper specific CKMR model. From this data set we can also assess fine-scale resolution of within and between group genetic diversity (i.e., genetic stock structure) and estimate the effective number of breeders in the population.
