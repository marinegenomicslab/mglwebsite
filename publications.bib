              Patterns of genetic variation reflect interactions among microevolutionary forces that vary in strength with changing demography. Here, patterns of variation within and among samples of the mouthbrooding gafftopsail catfish (
              Bagre marinus
              , Family Ariidae) captured in the U.S. Atlantic and throughout the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed using genomics to generate neutral and non‐neutral SNP data sets. Because genomic resources are lacking for ariids, linkage disequilibrium network analysis was used to examine patterns of putatively adaptive variation. Finally, historical demographic parameters were estimated from site frequency spectra. The results show four differentiated groups, corresponding to the (1) U.S. Atlantic, and the (2) northeastern, (3) northwestern, and (4) southern Gulf of Mexico. The non‐neutral data presented two contrasting signals of structure, one due to increases in diversity moving west to east and north to south, and another to increased heterozygosity in the Atlantic. Demographic analysis suggested that recently reduced long‐term effective population size in the Atlantic is likely an important driver of patterns of genetic variation and is consistent with a known reduction in population size potentially due to an epizootic. Overall, patterns of genetic variation resemble that of other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats as nurseries, regardless of the presence/absence of a larval phase, supporting the idea that adult/juvenile behavior and habitat are important predictors of contemporary patterns of genetic structure.

            Gafftopsail catfish show high levels of genetic structuring across their distribution in the U.S., Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Non‐neutral data present two contrasting signals of structure and historical demography is likely an important driver of patterns of neutral and non‐neutral genetic variation. Results of this study are similar to what is seen in other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats as nurseries, but gafftopsail catfish lack a larval phase, supporting the idea that adult/juvenile behavior and habitat use are important predictors of contemporary patterns of genetic structure.},

Therefore, age-predictive epigenetic clocks were developed for a model deepwater reef ﬁsh, blackbelly roseﬁsh Helicolenus dactylopterus, using two tissue types (ﬁn clips and muscle; n = 61 individuals; 9−60 years) and 14C-validated consensus age estimates. The inﬂuence of biological information (length and sex) on epigenetic clock accuracy, and the potential for developing a multi-tissue clock, were also assessed. Bisulﬁte-converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (bsRADseq) was used to identify CpG sites (cytosines followed by guanines) exhibiting age-correlated DNA methylation, and epigenetic clocks showed strong agreement (R2 {\textgreater} 0.98) between predicted and consensus ages. Including length and sex data enhanced accuracy and precision (R2 {\textgreater} 0.99; mean absolute error {\textless} 1 year). Age-associated CpG sites were identiﬁed across tissues, but a multi-tissue clock performed poorly relative to single-tissue clocks. Overall, results demonstrate that accurate and precise epigenetic clocks can be developed for deepwater ﬁshes, and the inclusion of biological information may enhance clock accuracy and precision.},

	abstract = {Essential habitat is required for a given species to complete its lifecycle and includes habitat for breeding, feeding, and growth. Estuaries provide essential habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based, gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including a shark, Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species, Hypanus americanus, that were not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species, Carcharhinus brevipinna, comprised 45\% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1\% of the total elasmobranch catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenile Carcharhinus brevipinna and Sphyrna lewini were observed across multiple years and in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled estuaries functions as a nursery. Although putative nurseries for these species have been identified elsewhere in the world, estuaries serving as nursery grounds in the western Gulf of Mexico are not well described.},

These alterations have disproportionately impacted the pelagic broadcast spawning guild of minnows (pelagophils). Several Rio Grande endemic pelagophils, including the co-occurring Rio Grande Shiner (Notropis jemezanus) and Speckled Chub (Macrhybopsis aestivalis), have experienced dramatic recent range-wide declines yet have slipped under the radar of conservation efforts. The status of N. jemezanus and M. aestivalis in the Rio Grande and Pecos River was evaluated and standing genetic variation was characterized. Genetic evidence indicates that populations of both species found in the Rio Grande and Pecos River are genetically distinct. Additionally, 159 outlier loci were identified in M. aestivalis suggesting possible local adaptation in the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations. Though range-wide genetic data are limited, N. jemezanus populations in both rivers harbor considerable genetic diversity. Mitochondrial data from both taxa are consistent with a history of secondary contact between formerly isolated populations with deeply divergent haplotypes found within the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations of N. jemezanus and within the Rio Grande population of M. aestivalis. Extensive survey efforts in the lower Rio Grande and its tributaries in Texas document significant range contraction and near extirpation of N. jemezanus from this part of the basin; highlighting the need for immediate action to protect the species.},

Because the species are indistinguishable based on external morphology, little research focused on Carolina hammerheads exists. In this study, the distribution of Carolina hammerheads in waters of the United States off the east coast (U.S. Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was examined and their abundance relative to scalloped hammerheads assessed by genetically identifying 1231 individuals using diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both species were found in the U.S. Atlantic, where 27 \% of individuals were Carolina hammerheads, but only scalloped hammerheads were identified in the Gulf. In Bulls Bay, SC, a well-known hammerhead nursery, assessment of relative abundance from May to September showed scalloped hammerheads were more abundant May-June and Carolina hammerheads more abundant July-September. Results of this study suggest Carolina hammerheads have a spatially limited distribution in the western North Atlantic and highlight the importance of Bulls Bay as a nursery for the species. In addition, the results suggest Carolina hammerheads may comprise a non-trivial proportion of what is considered the U.S. Atlantic scalloped hammerhead stock and should be considered in future decisions regarding management of the hammerhead complex.},

While hierarchical AmovA revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity. Overall, results suggest that there is genetic spatial autocorrelation caused by shared larval sources for proximal nurseries (migration/drift), but that it is modified by environmentally driven differentiation (selection). This leads to conflicting signals in different parts of the genome and creates patterns of divergence that do not correspond to paradigms of strong local directional selection.},

The results support Atlantic and GOM stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously.},

We conducted a series of controlled feeding experiments, with red lionfish (Pterois volitans) as predators and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) as prey, designed to test the effect of digestion time (12–42 h), prey item (sample) preservation (inside versus outside stomach), and sample preparation (washed versus unwashed) on DNA barcoding classification accuracy. Competitive interactions occurred between lionfish and killifish DNA during PCR amplification when universal COI primers were utilized; thus, primers were designed that matched the same priming site in both killifish and lionfish DNA. The proportion of amplified killifish DNA relative to lionfish DNA per sample was estimated using multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) and shown to decrease with longer digestion times, especially when samples were retained within lionfish stomachs for preservation. The effects of digestion and preservation method on amplifiable DNA resulted in significant effects on barcoding accuracy, resulting in erroneous identification of the predator (i.e., self-DNA) for nearly 25\% of samples. Removing prey from predator stomachs prior to preservation significantly increased the proportion of amplified killifish DNA from samples, and enhanced barcoding accuracy. Overall, study results have important implications for the probability of false negatives for prey items, as well as false positives for selfDNA, when utilizing barcoding to characterize piscine diet. Results also highlight the need to conduct more method validation research given the increasing prevalence of DNA barcoding as a means to identify specific prey items in fish diet studies.},

Most studies of connectivity involving reserves focus on fishes with characteristics atypical for exploited species, making the results less applicable to fisheries management. Here, patterns of genomic diversity were assessed within and among geographic samples of juvenile of silk snapper, Lutjanus vivanus, collected in protected and fished areas on the western coast of Puerto Rico. The results indicate significant variation in spatiotemporal genetic recruitment patterns, with the two MPAs located off the shelf having partially decoupled recruitment processes from sites on the shelf. Spatial autocorrelation was found at distances less than 20 km within years, but the degree and pattern of spatial structure differed across years, suggesting that recruitment along the west coast of Puerto Rico originates from semi-independent units of spawners whose contribution varies in space and time. The results suggest that while MPAs may work to supplement fisheries where recruitment is spatiotemporally predictable, in species for which adult contribution is variable in space and time, other management strategies should be explored as well.},

	abstract = {Stock enhancement is an increasingly popular fisheries management strategy in which high mortality of early life history stages is circumvented by rearing juveniles in controlled or semi-controlled conditions. While the success of such programs is generally measured by the number of stocked individuals or individuals recruiting to the wild populations, an important consideration is minimizing impacts to the genetic diversity of wild populations by maximizing the number of breeders contributing to stocked progeny. The contribution of individual breeders is impacted both by variance in spawning success among adults and variance in mortality among families during grow-out. To disentangle the effects that these sources of variance have on parental contribution, red drum broodfish participating in three spawning events at the TWPD Marine Development Center were genotyped at several thousand SNP-containing loci along with their progeny. Progeny were sampled at three time points; shortly after introduction to grow-out ponds (T1), approximately midway through grow-out (T2), and as fingerlings during harvesting to be stocked in bays (T3). Using composite genotypes, progeny were assigned to parents to determine the reproductive success of individual broodfish at T1, T2, and T3 and to identify changes in the effective number of breeders (Nb) during rearing in grow-out ponds. Relationships between reproductive success and broodfish-specific parameters, including age and condition when introduced to the hatchery, time spent in the hatchery, and estimated age at spawning were assessed. Finally, associations between components of genomic variation in progeny from each sampling period and environmental parameters including salinity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen present in the grow-out ponds, were identified. The results indicate that initial variance in reproductive success, including the failure of some individuals to spawn successfully, has the greatest impact on Nb. Mortality during growth had a relatively small impact on Nb and, in some cases, led to increases in Nb. Further, both family and environmental conditions in the outdoor rearing ponds significantly shaped the genetic diversity of stocked yearlings. Overall, these findings indicate that outdoor rearing in a semicontrolled environment exposes progeny to a range of environmental conditions across the season, which appears to play a role in maintaining and sometimes increasing Nb.},

              Understanding how interactions among microevolutionary forces generate genetic population structure of exploited species is vital to the implementation of management policies that facilitate persistence. Philopatry displayed by many coastal shark species can impact gene flow and facilitate selection, and has direct implications for the spatial scales of management. Here, genetic structure of the blacktip shark (
              Carcharhinus limbatus
              ) was examined using a mixed‐marker approach employing mitochondrial control region sequences and 4339 SNP‐containing loci generated using ddRAD‐Seq. Genetic variation was assessed among young‐of‐the‐year sampled in 11 sites in waters of the United States in the western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico. Spatial and environmental analyses detected 68 nuclear loci putatively under selection, enabling separate assessments of neutral and adaptive genetic structure. Both mitochondrial and neutral SNP data indicated three genetically distinct units—the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and western Gulf—that align with regional stocks and suggest regional philopatry by males and females. Heterogeneity at loci putatively under selection, associated with temperature and salinity, was observed among sites within Gulf units, suggesting local adaptation. Furthermore, five pairs of siblings were identified in the same site across timescales corresponding with female reproductive cycles. This indicates that females re‐used a site for parturition, which has the potential to facilitate the sorting of adaptive variation among neighbouring sites. The results demonstrate differential impacts of microevolutionary forces at varying spatial scales and highlight the importance of conserving essential habitats to maintain sources of adaptive variation that may buffer species against environmental change.},

	abstract = {Colonization of the New World by marine taxa has been hypothesized to have occurred through the Tethys Sea or by crossing the East Pacific Barrier. To better understand patterns and timing of diversification, geological events can be coupled with time calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses to infer major drivers of diversification. Phylogenetic relationships among members of Sphoeroides, a genus of four toothed pufferfishes (Tetraodontiformes: Tetraodontidae) which are found nearly exclusively in the New World (eastern Pacific and western Atlantic), were reconstructed using sequences from ultra-conserved DNA elements, nuclear markers with clear homology among many vertebrate taxa. Hypotheses derived from concatenated maximum-likelihood and species tree summary methods support a paraphyletic Sphoeroides, with Colomesus deeply nested within the genus. Analyses also revealed S. pachygaster, a pelagic species with a cosmopolitan distribution, as the sister taxon to the remainder of Sphoeroides and recovered distinct lineages within S. pachygaster, indicating that this cosmopolitan species may represent a species complex. Ancestral range reconstruction may suggest the genus colonized the New World through the eastern Pacific before diversifying in the western Atlantic, though date estimates for these events are uncertain due to the lack of reliable fossil record for the genus.},

	abstract = {Globally, many pond turtles (Family Emydidae) are of conservation concern due to contracting ranges, increasingly fragmented habitats, and declining populations. One of these turtles, the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), is of concern within the United States, but surveying potential estuarine habitat for the presence of the species requires high levels of time and effort. Here a species-specific, probe-based qPCR assay for identifying terrapin DNA from environmental DNA (eDNA) is described. To expand the utility of this tool, the assay was designed to allow for potential detection of at least 19 other pond turtles taxa and the utility was tested by designing a second species-specific probe for red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) with a different fluorophore, which can be used simultaneously with the terrapin probe to detect either species. Probes were found to be species-specific and effective at detecting low levels of DNA for the target species, the diamondback terrapin (10 fg/µL) and the red-eared slider (100 fg/µL) in laboratory conditions. The assay also showed species-specific detection in environmental samples taken from field locations where one species or the other were known to reside. Through citizen science approaches, this assay could be used for discovering novel terrapin habitats, monitoring invasive red-eared slider populations or surveying other emydids, with species-specific probes, at a fraction of the cost of traditional surveys.},
