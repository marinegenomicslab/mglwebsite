abstract: 'Colonization of the New World by marine taxa has been hypothesized to have
  occurred through the Tethys Sea or by crossing the East Pacific Barrier. To better
  understand patterns and timing of diversification, geological events can be coupled
  with time calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses to infer major drivers of diversification.
  Phylogenetic relationships among members of Sphoeroides, a genus of four toothed
  pufferfishes (Tetraodontiformes: Tetraodontidae) which are found nearly exclusively
  in the New World (eastern Pacific and western Atlantic), were reconstructed using
  sequences from ultra-conserved DNA elements, nuclear markers with clear homology
  among many vertebrate taxa. Hypotheses derived from concatenated maximum-likelihood
  and species tree summary methods support a paraphyletic Sphoeroides, with Colomesus
  deeply nested within the genus. Analyses also revealed S. pachygaster, a pelagic
  species with a cosmopolitan distribution, as the sister taxon to the remainder of
  Sphoeroides and recovered distinct lineages within S. pachygaster, indicating that
  this cosmopolitan species may represent a species complex. Ancestral range reconstruction
  may suggest the genus colonized the New World through the eastern Pacific before
  diversifying in the western Atlantic, though date estimates for these events are
  uncertain due to the lack of reliable fossil record for the genus.'
