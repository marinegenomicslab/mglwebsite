abstract: 'Restriction site‐associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to characterize
  neutral and adaptive genetic variation among geographic samples of red drum, Sciaenops
  ocellatus, an estuarine‐dependent fish found in coastal waters along the southeastern
  coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Analyses
  of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters:
  one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated
  gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence
  in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral
  loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence
  between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier
  and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive
  responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter
  largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial
  retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting
  with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have
  led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences
  accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome.
  This same dynamic also may pertain to other coastal or nearshore fishes (18 species
  in 14 families) where genetically or morphologically defined sister taxa occur in
  the three regions.'
