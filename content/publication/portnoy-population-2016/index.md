abstract: "Patterns of population structure, genetic demographics, and gene ﬂow in
  the small coastal shark Carcharhinus isodon (ﬁnetooth shark) sampled from two discrete
  nurseries along the southeastern US coast (Atlantic) and three nurseries in the
  northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), were assessed using 16 nuclear-encoded microsatellites
  and 1077 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Signiﬁcant
  heterogeneity in microsatellite allele distributions was detected among all localities
  except between the two in the Atlantic. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in mtDNA haplotypes
  was not detected, a result likely due to extremely low mtDNA diversity. The genetic
  discontinuities combined with seasonal movement patterns, a patchy distribution
  of appropriate nursery habitat, the apparent absence of sex-biased gene ﬂow, and
  the occurrence of mating in the vicinity of nursery areas, suggest that both male
  and female ﬁnetooth sharks display regional philopatry to discrete nursery areas.
  Global and local tests of neutrality, using mtDNA haplotypes, and demographic model
  testing, using Approximate Bayesian Computation of microsatellite alleles, supported
  a range-wide expansion of ﬁnetooth sharks into US waters occurring less than \x18
  9000 years ago. These ﬁndings add to the growing number of studies in a variety
  of coastally distributed marine ﬁshes documenting signiﬁcant barriers to gene ﬂow
  around peninsular Florida and in the eastern Gulf. The ﬁndings also provide further
  evidence that the traditional model of behavioural ecology, based on large coastal
  sharks, may not be appropriate for understanding and conserving small coastal sharks."
