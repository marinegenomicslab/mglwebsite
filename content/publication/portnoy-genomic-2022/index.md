abstract: Red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, supports one of the more important ﬁsheries
  in marine waters of the United States. Consequently, it has been the focus of intensive
  ﬁsheries research for more than  years. Here, we present a genomic analysis of
  population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns
  of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) alongside a synoptic
  view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and GOM
  stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis
  using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability,
  and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales,
  with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position
  or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in
  the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity
  along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape
  genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation
  dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species
  that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously.
