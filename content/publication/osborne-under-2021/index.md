abstract: The Rio Grande drainage of the southwestern United States and Mexico has
  undergone intense anthropogenic alteration by water diversions, extraction and associated
  habitat changes. These alterations have disproportionately impacted the pelagic
  broadcast spawning guild of minnows (pelagophils). Several Rio Grande endemic pelagophils,
  including the co-occurring Rio Grande Shiner (Notropis jemezanus) and Speckled Chub
  (Macrhybopsis aestivalis), have experienced dramatic recent range-wide declines
  yet have slipped under the radar of conservation efforts. The status of N. jemezanus
  and M. aestivalis in the Rio Grande and Pecos River was evaluated and standing genetic
  variation was characterized. Genetic evidence indicates that populations of both
  species found in the Rio Grande and Pecos River are genetically distinct. Additionally,
  159 outlier loci were identified in M. aestivalis suggesting possible local adaptation
  in the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations. Though range-wide genetic data are
  limited, N. jemezanus populations in both rivers harbor considerable genetic diversity.
  Mitochondrial data from both taxa are consistent with a history of secondary contact
  between formerly isolated populations with deeply divergent haplotypes found within
  the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations of N. jemezanus and within the Rio Grande
  population of M. aestivalis. Extensive survey efforts in the lower Rio Grande and
  its tributaries in Texas document significant range contraction and near extirpation
  of N. jemezanus from this part of the basin; highlighting the need for immediate
  action to protect the species.
