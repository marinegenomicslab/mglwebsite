 abstract = {The Leuciscidae (minnows, shiners and relatives) is a diverse family of freshwater fishes with many species endangered due to anthropogenic stressors. Notropis oxyrhynchus and Notropis buccula are two shiners found only in the upper Brazos River basin in Texas, USA and listed as endangered due to contracted habitat. The complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced for two vouchered specimens for each species; Notropis oxyrhynchus having a total mitogenome length of 16,711 bp and N. buccula having a total mitogenome length 16685â€“16686 bp, with both including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis supports previous hypotheses regarding placement of these species.},
