abstract: Marine protected areas (MPAs) have the potential to conserve biodiversity
  and improve fishery sustainability, but their efficacy depends on sound design and
  implementation, which requires an understanding of connectivity among reserves and
  between reserves and fished areas. Most studies of connectivity involving reserves
  focus on fishes with characteristics atypical for exploited species, making the
  results less applicable to fisheries management. Here, patterns of genomic diversity
  were assessed within and among geographic samples of juvenile of silk snapper, Lutjanus
  vivanus, collected in protected and fished areas on the western coast of Puerto
  Rico. The results indicate significant variation in spatiotemporal genetic recruitment
  patterns, with the two MPAs located off the shelf having partially decoupled recruitment
  processes from sites on the shelf. Spatial autocorrelation was found at distances
  less than 20 km within years, but the degree and pattern of spatial structure differed
  across years, suggesting that recruitment along the west coast of Puerto Rico originates
  from semi-independent units of spawners whose contribution varies in space and time.
  The results suggest that while MPAs may work to supplement fisheries where recruitment
  is spatiotemporally predictable, in species for which adult contribution is variable
  in space and time, other management strategies should be explored as well.
