abstract: Abstract  Understanding how interactions among microevolutionary forces
  generate genetic population structure of exploited species is vital to the implementation
  of management policies that facilitate persistence. Philopatry displayed by many
  coastal shark species can impact gene flow and facilitate selection, and has direct
  implications for the spatial scales of management. Here, genetic structure of the
  blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus limbatus ) was examined using a mixed‐marker approach
  employing mitochondrial control region sequences and 4339 SNP‐containing loci generated
  using ddRAD‐Seq. Genetic variation was assessed among young‐of‐the‐year sampled
  in 11 sites in waters of the United States in the western North Atlantic Ocean,
  including the Gulf of Mexico. Spatial and environmental analyses detected 68 nuclear
  loci putatively under selection, enabling separate assessments of neutral and adaptive
  genetic structure. Both mitochondrial and neutral SNP data indicated three genetically
  distinct units—the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and western Gulf—that align with regional
  stocks and suggest regional philopatry by males and females. Heterogeneity at loci
  putatively under selection, associated with temperature and salinity, was observed
  among sites within Gulf units, suggesting local adaptation. Furthermore, five pairs
  of siblings were identified in the same site across timescales corresponding with
  female reproductive cycles. This indicates that females re‐used a site for parturition,
  which has the potential to facilitate the sorting of adaptive variation among neighbouring
  sites. The results demonstrate differential impacts of microevolutionary forces
  at varying spatial scales and highlight the importance of conserving essential habitats
  to maintain sources of adaptive variation that may buffer species against environmental
  change.
