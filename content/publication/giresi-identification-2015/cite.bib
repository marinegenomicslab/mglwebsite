 abstract = {Identiﬁcation of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently, species-speciﬁc management of smoothhound shark resources is difﬁcult when multiple species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identiﬁcation and distribution of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using sequences of mitochondrial DNA, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data. Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded ND-2 sequences and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were identiﬁed as Smooth Dogﬁsh Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi, and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests of species-speciﬁc means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude, and month) at capture indicated signiﬁcant differences among the three species with respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogﬁsh is found in deeper waters than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow waters. A diagnostic key for the ﬁeld identiﬁcation of adult specimens of each species is provided.},
