abstract: The Leon Springs pupfish, Cyprinodon bovinus, is federally listed as endangered
  and currently confined to spring-fed pools on the Diamond Y Spring Preserve in Pecos
  County, Texas, USA. A refuge population is maintained by U.S. Fish and Wildlife
  Service in Dexter, New Mexico, USA because of ongoing threats from hybridization
  with the introduced congener, the sheepshead minnow, C. variegatus. To inform continued
  conservation and management planning for this species, a comprehensive conservation
  genomics study using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing was
  performed. No evidence of contemporary hybridization or recent introgression between
  C. bovinus and C. variegatus was found. The refuge population was significantly
  differentiated from wild samples collected at two locations, and the two wild populations
  (less than 1 km apart) also exhibited significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies.
  Estimates of within population diversity were smaller for wild locations than the
  refuge population. Correspondingly, the wild populations’ contemporary effective
  population size estimates were smaller than the refuge’s effective population size
  estimates (145–262 versus 679). Temporal analyses, involving genetic data collected
  from samples obtained in 2013, suggest an increased magnitude of drift acting on
  the wild populations relative to the reserve population. Based on the results of
  this study, it appears that steps taken in the early 2000s to eradicate genetically
  admixed individuals from the wild populations were successful. However, habitat
  fragmentation and small effective population sizes of the wild populations have
  led to accelerated drift and decreasing levels of within population genetic diversity.
  This may jeopardize the long-term persistence of C. bovinus.
