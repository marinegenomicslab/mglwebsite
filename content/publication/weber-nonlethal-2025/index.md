abstract: 'Black basses (Micropterus spp.) are the most popular freshwater sportfishes
  in North America, with high recreational, societal, and economic value. The conservation
  and management of black bass fisheries rely on the generation of age data to estimate
  population dynamics. Age data are typically produced via counts of opaque zones
  in otolith sections, a necessarily lethal process. The development of an accurate,
  nonlethal age estimation method would expand opportunities for collecting age-related
  information in cases where sacrificing fish is either not an option (e.g., tournaments)
  or undesirable (e.g., trophy-sized fish). An epigenetic clock was developed for
  Florida bass (Micropterus salmoides) using DNA extracted from fin clips and enzymatically
  converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (EC-RADseq). CpG sites exhibiting
  age-correlated DNA methylation were identified using Bayesian generalized linear
  models in individuals (n = 176; age range: 0.84–13.21 years) captured from six different
  water bodies across Florida, USA, and potential environmentally influenced, age-predictive
  sites were identified and removed. The epigenetic clock developed using elastic
  net regression was highly accurate (mean absolute error, MAE = 0.28 years) and precise
  (R2 = 0.98). Overall, results demonstrate an accurate, nonlethal alternative to
  otolith-based age determination of Florida bass and could likely be applied to other
  black basses. In addition, when compared to traditional age estimation via hard
  structures, epigenetic age estimation is relatively rapid and cost-effective, with
  important implications for black bass assessment, management, and conservation.'
