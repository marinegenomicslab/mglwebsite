abstract: Patterns of genetic variation reflect interactions among microevolutionary forces
  that vary in strength with changing demography. Here, patterns of variation within
  and among samples of the mouthbrooding gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus, Family
  Ariidae) captured in the U.S. Atlantic and throughout the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed
  using genomics to generate neutral and non-neutral
  SNP data sets. Because
  genomic resources are lacking for ariids, linkage disequilibrium network analysis was
  used to examine patterns of putatively adaptive variation. Finally, historical demographic
  parameters were estimated from site frequency spectra. The results show four
  differentiated groups, corresponding to the (1) U.S. Atlantic, and the (2) northeastern,
  (3) northwestern, and (4) southern Gulf of Mexico. The non-neutral
  data presented
  two contrasting signals of structure, one due to increases in diversity moving west
  to east and north to south, and another to increased heterozygosity in the Atlantic.
  Demographic analysis suggested that recently reduced long-term
  effective population
  size in the Atlantic is likely an important driver of patterns of genetic variation and is consistent with a known reduction in population size potentially due to an epizootic.
  Overall, patterns of genetic variation resemble that of other fishes that use the same
  estuarine habitats as nurseries, regardless of the presence/absence of a larval phase,
  supporting the idea that adult/juvenile behavior and habitat are important predictors
  of contemporary patterns of genetic structure.
