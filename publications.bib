	abstract = {Spawning patterns and reproductive variance of Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus dams and sires at two restoration enhancement facilities in Texas were assessed across a spawning year by using parentage analysis based on 12 variable microsatellite loci. In total, 72.6\% of all dams and sires contributed to at least one spawning event, although in contrasting patterns. Across all spawning events assayed, more sires contributed to each spawn, on average, than did dams; dams had considerably higher variance in reproductive success than sires. Dams alternatively had a higher average contribution to the number of progeny from a single spawn but also a much higher variance in the number of progeny produced per spawn. The variation in the number of progeny produced per dam and per sire and the number of actual mating combinations led to an average reduction of 64.3\% in the genetic effective population size (Ne) per spawn relative to the maximum Ne that would be expected if (1) all possible dam × sire mating combinations occurred at random and (2) all families contained an equal number of progeny. Averaged over all spawns, the actual number of mating combinations accounted for approximately 83.6\% of the total reduction in Ne, while variation in family size accounted for 16.4\% of the total reduction in Ne. Results from this and other studies indicate that reductions in Ne of hatchery- or farm-raised progeny stem primarily from noncontributing dams, suggesting that periodic identiﬁcation and removal of low-contributing dams from broodﬁsh stocks constitute a critical step toward maximizing the Ne of hatchery offspring used in restoration enhancement.},

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity and/or inferred barriers to gene ﬂow, based on microsatellites and/or {mtDNA}, revealed the occurrence of ﬁve genetic populations localized to ﬁve geographic regions: the southeastern U.S Atlantic coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the western Gulf of Mexico, Bay of Campeche in the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas. Pairwise estimates of genetic divergence between sharks in the Bahamas and those in all other localities were more than an order of magnitude higher than between pairwise comparisons involving the other localities. Demographic modelling indicated that sharks in all ﬁve regions diverged after the last glacial maximum and, except for the Bahamas, experienced post-glacial, population expansion. The patterns of genetic variation also suggest that the southern Gulf of Mexico may have served as a glacial refuge and source for the expansion. Results of the study demonstrate that barriers to gene ﬂow and historical genetic demography contributed to contemporary patterns of population structure in a coastal migratory species living in an otherwise continuous marine habitat. The results also indicate that for many marine species, failure to properly characterize barriers in terms of levels of contemporary gene ﬂow could in part be due to inferences based solely on equilibrium assumptions. This could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding levels of connectivity in species of conservation concern.},

Initial tests ({FST}-based, hierarchical {AMOVA}) of spatial genetic homogeneity within and between regions were non-signiﬁcant, consistent with a single population or stock of red snapper in the Atlantic and Gulf. Inferences derived from other statistical approaches were consistent with genetic and/or demographic differences within and between the two regions. The estimated, average, long-term migration rate between the two regions (0.27\%) was well less than the 10\% rate below which populations can respond independently to environmental perturbation. Comparisons of global estimates of average, long-term effective size ({NeLT}) with estimates from individual sample localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf. Future genetics studies and other work on red snapper in both the Atlantic and Gulf should include approaches to identify demographically independent units within each region and assess their size, patterns of connectivity, and contribution to the ﬁshery. Monitoring global and/or local effective size also should be considered.},

	abstract = {Identiﬁcation of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently, species-speciﬁc management of smoothhound shark resources is difﬁcult when multiple species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identiﬁcation and distribution of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using sequences of mitochondrial {DNA}, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data. Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded {ND}-2 sequences and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were identiﬁed as Smooth Dogﬁsh Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi, and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests of species-speciﬁc means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude, and month) at capture indicated signiﬁcant differences among the three species with respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogﬁsh is found in deeper waters than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow waters. A diagnostic key for the ﬁeld identiﬁcation of adult specimens of each species is provided.},

We assessed spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded, single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and sequences of the mitochondrial control region in bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic patterns of {mtDNA} haplotypes and putatively neutral {SNPs} conﬁrmed female philopatry and male-mediated gene ﬂow along the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier {SNP} loci were identiﬁed; alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures of latitude-associated selection.

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in microsatellite allele distributions was detected among all localities except between the two in the Atlantic. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in {mtDNA} haplotypes was not detected, a result likely due to extremely low {mtDNA} diversity. The genetic discontinuities combined with seasonal movement patterns, a patchy distribution of appropriate nursery habitat, the apparent absence of sex-biased gene ﬂow, and the occurrence of mating in the vicinity of nursery areas, suggest that both male and female ﬁnetooth sharks display regional philopatry to discrete nursery areas. Global and local tests of neutrality, using {mtDNA} haplotypes, and demographic model testing, using Approximate Bayesian Computation of microsatellite alleles, supported a range-wide expansion of ﬁnetooth sharks into {US} waters occurring less than 9000 years ago. These ﬁndings add to the growing number of studies in a variety of coastally distributed marine ﬁshes documenting signiﬁcant barriers to gene ﬂow around peninsular Florida and in the eastern Gulf.

Using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, we surveyed variation in 7,382 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) young-of-the-year (YOY) sampled at six localities and in adults sampled at two localities in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Significant genetic heterogeneity was detected between the two adult samples, separated by approximately 600 km, and at spatial scales less than five kilometers among samples of YOY. Genetic differences between YOY samples and between YOY samples and adult samples were not associated with geographic distance, and a genome scan revealed no evidence of loci under selection. Estimates of the effective number of breeders, allelic richness, and relatedness within YOY samples were not consistent with sweepstakes recruitment. Instead, the data demonstrate, at least within one recruitment season, that multiple pulses of recruits originate from distinct groups of spawning adults, even at small spatial scales. For exploited species with this type of recruitment pattern, protection of spawning adults over wide geographic areas may be critical for ensuring productivity and stability of the fishery by maintaining larval supply and connectivity.},

We used a prior microsatellite-based linkage map as a framework and incorporated 1794 haplotyped contigs derived from high-throughput, reduced representation DNA sequencing to produce a linkage map containing 1794 haplotyped restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) contigs, 437 anonymous microsatellites, and 44 expressed sequence-tag-linked microsatellites (EST-SSRs). A total of 274 candidate genes, identified from transcripts from a preliminary hydrocarbon exposure study, were localized to specific chromosomes, using a shared synteny approach.

Bellator was always recovered within the genus Prionotus, a result supported by post hoc model testing. Two nominal species of Prionotus (P. alatus and P. paralatus) were not recovered as exclusive lineages, suggesting the two may comprise a single species.

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of reduced-representation genomic libraries provides a powerful methodology for genotyping thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among individuals of nonmodel species. Utilizing genotype data in the absence of a reference genome, however, presents a number of challenges. One major challenge is the trade-off between splitting alleles at a single locus into separate clusters (loci), creating inflated homozygosity, and lumping multiple loci into a single contig (locus), creating artefacts and inflated heterozygosity. This issue has been addressed primarily through the use of similarity cut-offs in sequence clustering. Here, two commonly employed postclustering filtering methods (read depth and excess heterozygosity) used to identify incorrectly assembled loci are compared with haplotyping, another postclustering filtering approach. Simulated and empirical data sets were used to demonstrate that each of the three methods separately identified incorrectly assembled loci; more optimal results were achieved when the three methods were applied in combination. The results confirmed that including incorrectly assembled loci in population-genetic data sets inflates estimates of heterozygosity and deflates estimates of population divergence. Additionally, at low levels of population divergence, physical linkage between SNPs within a locus created artificial clustering in analyses that assume markers are independent. Haplotyping SNPs within a locus effectively neutralized the physical linkage issue without having to thin data to a single SNP per locus. We introduce a Perl script that haplotypes polymorphisms, using data from single or paired-end reads, and identifies potentially problematic loci.},

The pipeline, written in BASH, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of RAD loci, read mapping, SNP and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest RAD data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare dDocent with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of RADseq data. dDocent consistently identified more SNPs shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that dDocent quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with INDEL polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and SNP calling.

  abstract = {Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, historically support a substantial fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southern United States. Low year-class strengths over the past few years in the western Gulf of Mexico have raised concern that spawning stocks may be overfished. Current management of the resource includes releasing hatchery-raised juveniles to restock bays and estuaries; additionally, there is a growing interest in the potential for commercial aquaculture of the species. Currently, genomic resources for southern flounder do not exist. Here, we used two hatchery-reared families and double-digest, restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to create a reduced-representation genomic library consisting of several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located throughout the genome. Results: The relative position of each SNP-containing locus was determined to create a high-density genetic map spanning the 24 linkage groups of the southern flounder genome. The consensus map was used to identify regions of shared synteny between southern flounder and seven other fish species for which genome assemblies are available. Finally, syntenic blocks were used to localize genes identified from transcripts in European flounder as potentially being involved in ecotoxicological and osmoregulatory responses, as well as QTLs associated with growth and disease resistance in Japanese flounder, on the southern flounder linkage map. Conclusions: The information provided by the linkage map will enrich restoration efforts by providing a foundation for interpreting spatial genetic variation within the species, ultimately furthering an understanding of the adaptive potential and resilience of southern flounder to future changes in local environmental conditions. Further, the map will facilitate the use of genetic markers to enhance restoration and commercial aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Sequencing reduced‐representation libraries of restriction site‐associated DNA (RADseq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of RADseq data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of SNP data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to RADseq methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous SNP calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four RAD data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.},

  abstract = {Restriction site‐associated DNA (RAD) sequencing was used to characterize neutral and adaptive genetic variation among geographic samples of red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, an estuarine‐dependent fish found in coastal waters along the southeastern coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Analyses of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters: one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome. This same dynamic also may pertain to other coastal or nearshore fishes (18 species in 14 families) where genetically or morphologically defined sister taxa occur in the three regions.},

Here we report on the detection of hybrids between the globally distributed scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and recently described Carolina hammerhead (S. gilberti) which are only known from the western Atlantic Ocean. Using a genomics approach, 10 first-generation hybrids and 15–17 backcrosses were detected from 554 individuals. The identification of backcrosses demonstrates hybrids are viable, and all backcrosses but one involved a scalloped hammerhead. All hybrids but one possessed Carolina hammerhead mtDNA, indicating sex-biased gene flow between species. Repeated hybridization and backcrossing with scalloped hammerheads could lead to the loss of endemic Carolina hammerheads.},

  abstract = {South Florida has been identified as a genetic break for multiple mobile marine taxa but the mechanisms that impede gene flow largely remain unknown. To understand how South Florida functions as a barrier for blacknose shark, a highly migratory species that has genetically diverged Atlantic and Gulf populations, patterns of genetic variation were assessed in 212 individuals sampled from the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and Florida Keys at 2213 nuclear-encoded SNP-containing loci. Results support divergence between the Gulf and Atlantic (FST ~ 0.002, P < 0.05), and 51 individuals caught in the Keys were assigned to the Gulf, as compared to only two individuals that assigned to the Atlantic, indicating that Florida Keys is largely composed of Gulf individuals. Further, two to three migrants were identified, all of which were Gulf individuals captured in the Atlantic. The results indicate that South Florida does not prevent individual movement between the Gulf and Atlantic and that the Keys may be a seasonal mixing zone. However, the Gulf and Atlantic remain genetically independent, suggesting that region-specific reproductive behavior/compatibility, or aspects of movement ecology, such as swimming energetics or temperature-driven interannual variability in migratory range, may maintain divergence rather than a physical barrier in South Florida.},

  abstract = {Essential habitat is required for a given species to complete its lifecycle and includes habitat for breeding, feeding, and growth. Estuaries provide essential habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based, gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including a shark, Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species, Hypanus americanus, that were not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species, Carcharhinus brevipinna, comprised 45\% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1\% of the total elasmobranch catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenile Carcharhinus brevipinna and Sphyrna lewini were observed across multiple years and in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled estuaries functions as a nursery. Although putative nurseries for these species have been identified elsewhere in the world, estuaries serving as nursery grounds in the western Gulf of Mexico are not well described.},

These alterations have disproportionately impacted the pelagic broadcast spawning guild of minnows (pelagophils). Several Rio Grande endemic pelagophils, including the co-occurring Rio Grande Shiner (Notropis jemezanus) and Speckled Chub (Macrhybopsis aestivalis), have experienced dramatic recent range-wide declines yet have slipped under the radar of conservation efforts. The status of N. jemezanus and M. aestivalis in the Rio Grande and Pecos River was evaluated and standing genetic variation was characterized. Genetic evidence indicates that populations of both species found in the Rio Grande and Pecos River are genetically distinct. Additionally, 159 outlier loci were identified in M. aestivalis suggesting possible local adaptation in the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations. Though range-wide genetic data are limited, N. jemezanus populations in both rivers harbor considerable genetic diversity. Mitochondrial data from both taxa are consistent with a history of secondary contact between formerly isolated populations with deeply divergent haplotypes found within the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations of N. jemezanus and within the Rio Grande population of M. aestivalis. Extensive survey efforts in the lower Rio Grande and its tributaries in Texas document significant range contraction and near extirpation of N. jemezanus from this part of the basin; highlighting the need for immediate action to protect the species.},

Because the species are indistinguishable based on external morphology, little research focused on Carolina hammerheads exists. In this study, the distribution of Carolina hammerheads in waters of the United States off the east coast (U.S. Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was examined and their abundance relative to scalloped hammerheads assessed by genetically identifying 1231 individuals using diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both species were found in the U.S. Atlantic, where 27 \% of individuals were Carolina hammerheads, but only scalloped hammerheads were identified in the Gulf. In Bulls Bay, {SC}, a well-known hammerhead nursery, assessment of relative abundance from May to September showed scalloped hammerheads were more abundant May-June and Carolina hammerheads more abundant July-September. Results of this study suggest Carolina hammerheads have a spatially limited distribution in the western North Atlantic and highlight the importance of Bulls Bay as a nursery for the species. In addition, the results suggest Carolina hammerheads may comprise a non-trivial proportion of what is considered the U.S. Atlantic scalloped hammerhead stock and should be considered in future decisions regarding management of the hammerhead complex.},

While hierarchical {AmovA} revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity. Overall, results suggest that there is genetic spatial autocorrelation caused by shared larval sources for proximal nurseries (migration/drift), but that it is modified by environmentally driven differentiation (selection). This leads to conflicting signals in different parts of the genome and creates patterns of divergence that do not correspond to paradigms of strong local directional selection.},

Consequently, it has been the focus of intensive ﬁsheries research for more than 20 years. Here, we present a genomic analysis of population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) alongside a synoptic view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and GOM stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously.},

We conducted a series of controlled feeding experiments, with red lionfish (Pterois volitans) as predators and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) as prey, designed to test the effect of digestion time (12–42 h), prey item (sample) preservation (inside versus outside stomach), and sample preparation (washed versus unwashed) on {DNA} barcoding classification accuracy. Competitive interactions occurred between lionfish and killifish {DNA} during {PCR} amplification when universal {COI} primers were utilized; thus, primers were designed that matched the same priming site in both killifish and lionfish {DNA}. The proportion of amplified killifish {DNA} relative to lionfish {DNA} per sample was estimated using multiplex quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) and shown to decrease with longer digestion times, especially when samples were retained within lionfish stomachs for preservation. The effects of digestion and preservation method on amplifiable {DNA} resulted in significant effects on barcoding accuracy, resulting in erroneous identification of the predator (i.e., self-{DNA}) for nearly 25\% of samples. Removing prey from predator stomachs prior to preservation significantly increased the proportion of amplified killifish {DNA} from samples, and enhanced barcoding accuracy. Overall, study results have important implications for the probability of false negatives for prey items, as well as false positives for {selfDNA}, when utilizing barcoding to characterize piscine diet. Results also highlight the need to conduct more method validation research given the increasing prevalence of {DNA} barcoding as a means to identify specific prey items in fish diet studies.},

Here, patterns of genomic diversity were assessed within and among geographic samples of juvenile of silk snapper, Lutjanus vivanus, collected in protected and fished areas on the western coast of Puerto Rico. The results indicate significant variation in spatiotemporal genetic recruitment patterns, with the two {MPAs} located off the shelf having partially decoupled recruitment processes from sites on the shelf. Spatial autocorrelation was found at distances less than 20 km within years, but the degree and pattern of spatial structure differed across years, suggesting that recruitment along the west coast of Puerto Rico originates from semi-independent units of spawners whose contribution varies in space and time. The results suggest that while {MPAs} may work to supplement fisheries where recruitment is spatiotemporally predictable, in species for which adult contribution is variable in space and time, other management strategies should be explored as well.},
