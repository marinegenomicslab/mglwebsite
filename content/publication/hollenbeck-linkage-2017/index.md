abstract: Developments in next-generation sequencing allow genotyping of thousands
  of genetic markers across hundreds of individuals in a cost-effective manner. Because
  of this, it is now possible to rapidly produce dense genetic linkage maps for nonmodel
  species. Here, we report a dense genetic linkage map for red drum, a marine fish
  species of considerable economic importance in the southeastern United States and
  elsewhere. We used a prior microsatellite-based linkage map as a framework and incorporated
  1794 haplotyped contigs derived from high-throughput, reduced representation DNA
  sequencing to produce a linkage map containing 1794 haplotyped restriction-site
  associated DNA (RAD) contigs, 437 anonymous microsatellites, and 44 expressed sequence-tag-linked
  microsatellites (EST-SSRs). A total of 274 candidate genes, identified from transcripts
  from a preliminary hydrocarbon exposure study, were localized to specific chromosomes,
  using a shared synteny approach. The linkage map will be a useful resource for red
  drum commercial and restoration aquaculture, and for better understanding and managing
  populations of red drum in the wild.
