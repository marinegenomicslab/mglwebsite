abstract: Hybridization between closely related species has been documented across
  a wide range of taxa but has not been well studied in elasmobranchs. Hammerhead
  sharks have drawn global conservation concern because they experience some of the
  highest mortality rates among sharks when interacting with fisheries. Here we report
  on the detection of hybrids between the globally distributed scalloped hammerhead
  (Sphyrna lewini) and recently described Carolina hammerhead (S. gilberti) which
  are only known from the western Atlantic Ocean. Using a genomics approach, 10 first-generation
  hybrids and 15â€“17 backcrosses were detected from 554 individuals. The identification
  of backcrosses demonstrates hybrids are viable, and all backcrosses but one involved
  a scalloped hammerhead. All hybrids but one possessed Carolina hammerhead mtDNA,
  indicating sex-biased gene flow between species. Repeated hybridization and backcrossing
  with scalloped hammerheads could lead to the loss of endemic Carolina hammerheads.
