abstract: Cutting-edge DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging techniques were applied
  to Gulf of Mexico northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus; n = 10; 1–26 years
  old) and red grouper (Epinephelus morio; n = 10; 2–14 years old). Bisulﬁteconverted
  restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was used to identify CpG sites (cytosines
  followed by guanines) that exhibit age-correlated DNA methylation, and species-speciﬁc
  epigenetic clocks developed from hundreds of CpG sites in each species showed strong
  agreement between predicted and otolith-derived age (r2 textgreater 0.99 for both
  species). Results suggest epigenetic age estimation could provide an accurate and
  efﬁcient approach to mass-aging ﬁshes in a non-invasive manner.
