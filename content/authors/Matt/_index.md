Joey Matt joined the Marine Genomics Lab in the summer of 2021.  His research has focused on oyster aquaculture and has investigated problems faced by the industry and addressed questions important to selection and breeding.  His current projects aim to develop tools and strategies to most efficiently breed oysters to improve traits important to the viability of oyster aquaculture, including implementing genomic-based breeding strategies.

Joey received a B.S. in Biology at Wake Forest University. He then worked as a technologist at the Aquaculture Breeding and Technology Center (ABC) at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), where he completed both a masters and doctorate program in fisheries science.
