abstract: Population structure of adult red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) from the
  southeastern coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northeastern Gulf of
  Mexico (Gulf) was assessed using genotypes at 16 nuclear-encoded microsatellites
  and mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotypes of the NADH dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) gene. Initial
  tests (FST-based, hierarchical AMOVA) of spatial genetic homogeneity within and
  between regions were non-signiﬁcant, consistent with a single population or stock
  of red snapper in the Atlantic and Gulf. Inferences derived from other statistical
  approaches were consistent with genetic and/or demographic differences within and
  between the two regions. The estimated, average, long-term migration rate between
  the two regions (0.27%) was well less than the 10% rate below which populations
  can respond independently to environmental perturbation. Comparisons of global estimates
  of average, long-term effective size (NeLT) with estimates from individual sample
  localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These
  results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf.
  Future genetics studies and other work on red snapper in both the Atlantic and Gulf
  should include approaches to identify demographically independent units within each
  region and assess their size, patterns of connectivity, and contribution to the
  ﬁshery. Monitoring global and/or local effective size also should be considered.
