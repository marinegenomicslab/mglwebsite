abstract: The use of DNA barcoding in fish diet studies is becoming more widespread,
  but the effect of prey digestion on barcoding accuracy has been poorly studied.
  We conducted a series of controlled feeding experiments, with red lionfish (Pterois
  volitans) as predators and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) as prey, designed to
  test the effect of digestion time (12â€“42 h), prey item (sample) preservation (inside
  versus outside stomach), and sample preparation (washed versus unwashed) on DNA
  barcoding classification accuracy. Competitive interactions occurred between lionfish
  and killifish DNA during PCR amplification when universal COI primers were utilized;
  thus, primers were designed that matched the same priming site in both killifish
  and lionfish DNA. The proportion of amplified killifish DNA relative to lionfish
  DNA per sample was estimated using multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) and shown to
  decrease with longer digestion times, especially when samples were retained within
  lionfish stomachs for preservation. The effects of digestion and preservation method
  on amplifiable DNA resulted in significant effects on barcoding accuracy, resulting
  in erroneous identification of the predator (i.e., self-DNA) for nearly 25% of samples.
  Removing prey from predator stomachs prior to preservation significantly increased
  the proportion of amplified killifish DNA from samples, and enhanced barcoding accuracy.
  Overall, study results have important implications for the probability of false
  negatives for prey items, as well as false positives for selfDNA, when utilizing
  barcoding to characterize piscine diet. Results also highlight the need to conduct
  more method validation research given the increasing prevalence of DNA barcoding
  as a means to identify specific prey items in fish diet studies.
