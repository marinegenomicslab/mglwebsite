Traditionally, species identification has been based on external morphology alone, but this can be problematic because of cryptic similarity among taxa, and the need for trained experts. This has led to the adoption of DNA-based identification techniques (often referred to as DNA-barcoding) thats offer many advantages over traditional methods. DNA-based identification can be used to accurately identify species using small pieces of tissue and confirm species presence using DNA passively shed into the environment (eDNA), which facilitates estimates of diversity as well as species monitoring. Additionally, DNA-based identification is relatively rapid and the cost to the end-user continues to decline on an annual basis. However, DNA-barcoding only works properly when sequences are associated with properly identified species, which should be vouchered to ensure accuracy. The goal of this project is to establish TX-FISH-DNA, a regionally focused DNA-database for all species of fishes inhabiting freshwater, estuarine and marine habitats in Texas. TX-FISH-DNA will be populated by reference DNA-sequences obtained from expert-verified and museum vouchered specimens collected from Texas waters and will offer diverse end users rapid access to high quality mitochondrial DNA sequences that can be applied to solve myriad scientific and societal problems.
