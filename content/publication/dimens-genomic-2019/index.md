abstract: South Florida has been identified as a genetic break for multiple mobile
  marine taxa but the mechanisms that impede gene flow largely remain unknown. To
  understand how South Florida functions as a barrier for blacknose shark, a highly
  migratory species that has genetically diverged Atlantic and Gulf populations, patterns
  of genetic variation were assessed in 212 individuals sampled from the Atlantic,
  eastern Gulf, and Florida Keys at 2213 nuclear-encoded SNP-containing loci. Results
  support divergence between the Gulf and Atlantic (FST ~ 0.002, P < 0.05), and 51
  individuals caught in the Keys were assigned to the Gulf, as compared to only two
  individuals that assigned to the Atlantic, indicating that Florida Keys is largely
  composed of Gulf individuals. Further, two to three migrants were identified, all
  of which were Gulf individuals captured in the Atlantic. The results indicate that
  South Florida does not prevent individual movement between the Gulf and Atlantic
  and that the Keys may be a seasonal mixing zone. However, the Gulf and Atlantic
  remain genetically independent, suggesting that region-specific reproductive behavior/compatibility,
  or aspects of movement ecology, such as swimming energetics or temperature-driven
  interannual variability in migratory range, may maintain divergence rather than
  a physical barrier in South Florida.
