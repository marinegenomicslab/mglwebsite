abstract: Phylogenetic relationships among members of the New World searobin genera
  Bellator and Prionotus (Family Triglidae, Subfamily Prionotinae) and among other
  searobins in the families Triglidae and Peristediidae were investigated using both
  mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. Phylogenetic hypotheses derived from maximum
  likelihood and Bayesian methodologies supported a monophyletic Prionotinae that
  included four well resolved clades of uncertain relationship; three contained species
  in the genus Prionotus and one contained species in the genus Bellator. Bellator
  was always recovered within the genus Prionotus, a result supported by post hoc
  model testing. Two nominal species of Prionotus (P. alatus and P. paralatus) were
  not recovered as exclusive lineages, suggesting the two may comprise a single species.
  Phylogenetic hypotheses also supported a monophyletic Triglidae but only if armored
  searobins (Family Peristediidae) were included. A robust morphological assessment
  is needed to further characterize relationships and suggest classification of clades
  within Prionotinae; for the time being we recommend that Bellator be considered
  a synonym of Prionotus. Relationships between armored searobins (Family Peristediidae)
  and searobins (Family Triglidae) and relationships within Triglidae also warrant
  further study.
