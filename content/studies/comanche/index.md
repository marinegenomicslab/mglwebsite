 The entire geographic range of the Comanche Springs pupfish falls within the Chihuahuan Desert Ecoregion of Texas, with contemporary populations restricted to fragmented, spring-associated habitats in Reeves and Jeff Davis counties, Texas. Comanche Springs pupfish have undergone population/range contraction within recent years in response to human activities, including water extraction, pollution, and are also imperiled by the introduction of the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus. Previous research highlighted reduced genetic variation in Comanche Springs pupfish from several wild populations and concluded that there was a need for more genetic resources to be developed. Conservation genomic work using next-generation sequencing techniques will allow for a robust assessment of standing genetic diversity within and among wild populations, as well as an assessment of the potential for current and/or historical hybridization with C. variegatus. In aAddition, diversity in wild populations will be compared to that in captive (reserve) populations to assess whether reserve populations adequately represent standing diversity in the wild.
