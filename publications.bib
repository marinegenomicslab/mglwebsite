	abstract = {Spawning patterns and reproductive variance of Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus dams and sires at two restoration enhancement facilities in Texas were assessed across a spawning year by using parentage analysis based on 12 variable microsatellite loci. In total, 72.6\% of all dams and sires contributed to at least one spawning event, although in contrasting patterns. Across all spawning events assayed, more sires contributed to each spawn, on average, than did dams; dams had considerably higher variance in reproductive success than sires. Dams alternatively had a higher average contribution to the number of progeny from a single spawn but also a much higher variance in the number of progeny produced per spawn. The variation in the number of progeny produced per dam and per sire and the number of actual mating combinations led to an average reduction of 64.3\% in the genetic effective population size (Ne) per spawn relative to the maximum Ne that would be expected if (1) all possible dam × sire mating combinations occurred at random and (2) all families contained an equal number of progeny. Averaged over all spawns, the actual number of mating combinations accounted for approximately 83.6\% of the total reduction in Ne, while variation in family size accounted for 16.4\% of the total reduction in Ne. Results from this and other studies indicate that reductions in Ne of hatchery- or farm-raised progeny stem primarily from noncontributing dams, suggesting that periodic identiﬁcation and removal of low-contributing dams from broodﬁsh stocks constitute a critical step toward maximizing the Ne of hatchery offspring used in restoration enhancement.},

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity and/or inferred barriers to gene ﬂow, based on microsatellites and/or {mtDNA}, revealed the occurrence of ﬁve genetic populations localized to ﬁve geographic regions: the southeastern U.S Atlantic coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the western Gulf of Mexico, Bay of Campeche in the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas. Pairwise estimates of genetic divergence between sharks in the Bahamas and those in all other localities were more than an order of magnitude higher than between pairwise comparisons involving the other localities. Demographic modelling indicated that sharks in all ﬁve regions diverged after the last glacial maximum and, except for the Bahamas, experienced post-glacial, population expansion. The patterns of genetic variation also suggest that the southern Gulf of Mexico may have served as a glacial refuge and source for the expansion. Results of the study demonstrate that barriers to gene ﬂow and historical genetic demography contributed to contemporary patterns of population structure in a coastal migratory species living in an otherwise continuous marine habitat. The results also indicate that for many marine species, failure to properly characterize barriers in terms of levels of contemporary gene ﬂow could in part be due to inferences based solely on equilibrium assumptions. This could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding levels of connectivity in species of conservation concern.},

Initial tests ({FST}-based, hierarchical {AMOVA}) of spatial genetic homogeneity within and between regions were non-signiﬁcant, consistent with a single population or stock of red snapper in the Atlantic and Gulf. Inferences derived from other statistical approaches were consistent with genetic and/or demographic differences within and between the two regions. The estimated, average, long-term migration rate between the two regions (0.27\%) was well less than the 10\% rate below which populations can respond independently to environmental perturbation. Comparisons of global estimates of average, long-term effective size ({NeLT}) with estimates from individual sample localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf. Future genetics studies and other work on red snapper in both the Atlantic and Gulf should include approaches to identify demographically independent units within each region and assess their size, patterns of connectivity, and contribution to the ﬁshery. Monitoring global and/or local effective size also should be considered.},

	abstract = {Identiﬁcation of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently, species-speciﬁc management of smoothhound shark resources is difﬁcult when multiple species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identiﬁcation and distribution of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using sequences of mitochondrial {DNA}, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data. Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded {ND}-2 sequences and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were identiﬁed as Smooth Dogﬁsh Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi, and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests of species-speciﬁc means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude, and month) at capture indicated signiﬁcant differences among the three species with respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogﬁsh is found in deeper waters than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow waters. A diagnostic key for the ﬁeld identiﬁcation of adult specimens of each species is provided.},

When site ﬁdelity occurs across a heterogeneous environment, local selective regimes may alter this pattern. We assessed spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded, single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and sequences of the mitochondrial control region in bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic patterns of {mtDNA} haplotypes and putatively neutral {SNPs} conﬁrmed female philopatry and male-mediated gene ﬂow along the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier {SNP} loci were identiﬁed; alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures of latitude-associated selection. Our results indicate that in species with sex-biased dispersal, philopatry can facilitate sorting of locally adaptive variation, with the dispersing sex facilitating movement of potentially adaptive variation among locations and environments.},

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in microsatellite allele distributions was detected among all localities except between the two in the Atlantic. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in {mtDNA} haplotypes was not detected, a result likely due to extremely low {mtDNA} diversity. The genetic discontinuities combined with seasonal movement patterns, a patchy distribution of appropriate nursery habitat, the apparent absence of sex-biased gene ﬂow, and the occurrence of mating in the vicinity of nursery areas, suggest that both male and female ﬁnetooth sharks display regional philopatry to discrete nursery areas. Global and local tests of neutrality, using {mtDNA} haplotypes, and demographic model testing, using Approximate Bayesian Computation of microsatellite alleles, supported a range-wide expansion of ﬁnetooth sharks into {US} waters occurring less than 9000 years ago. These ﬁndings add to the growing number of studies in a variety of coastally distributed marine ﬁshes documenting signiﬁcant barriers to gene ﬂow around peninsular Florida and in the eastern Gulf. The ﬁndings also provide further evidence that the traditional model of behavioural ecology, based on large coastal sharks, may not be appropriate for understanding and conserving small coastal sharks.},

  abstract = {Conservation and management of exploited species depends on accurate knowledge of how genetic variation is partitioned across a fishery, especially as it relates to recruitment. Using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, we surveyed variation in 7,382 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) young-of-the-year (YOY) sampled at six localities and in adults sampled at two localities in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Significant genetic heterogeneity was detected between the two adult samples, separated by approximately 600 km, and at spatial scales less than five kilometers among samples of YOY. Genetic differences between YOY samples and between YOY samples and adult samples were not associated with geographic distance, and a genome scan revealed no evidence of loci under selection. Estimates of the effective number of breeders, allelic richness, and relatedness within YOY samples were not consistent with sweepstakes recruitment. Instead, the data demonstrate, at least within one recruitment season, that multiple pulses of recruits originate from distinct groups of spawning adults, even at small spatial scales. For exploited species with this type of recruitment pattern, protection of spawning adults over wide geographic areas may be critical for ensuring productivity and stability of the fishery by maintaining larval supply and connectivity.},

We used a prior microsatellite-based linkage map as a framework and incorporated 1794 haplotyped contigs derived from high-throughput, reduced representation DNA sequencing to produce a linkage map containing 1794 haplotyped restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) contigs, 437 anonymous microsatellites, and 44 expressed sequence-tag-linked microsatellites (EST-SSRs). A total of 274 candidate genes, identified from transcripts from a preliminary hydrocarbon exposure study, were localized to specific chromosomes, using a shared synteny approach. The linkage map will be a useful resource for red drum commercial and restoration aquaculture, and for better understanding and managing populations of red drum in the wild.},

Bellator was always recovered within the genus Prionotus, a result supported by post hoc model testing. Two nominal species of Prionotus (P. alatus and P. paralatus) were not recovered as exclusive lineages, suggesting the two may comprise a single species. Phylogenetic hypotheses also supported a monophyletic Triglidae but only if armored searobins (Family Peristediidae) were included. A robust morphological assessment is needed to further characterize relationships and suggest classification of clades within Prionotinae; for the time being we recommend that Bellator be considered a synonym of Prionotus.

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of reduced-representation genomic libraries provides a powerful methodology for genotyping thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among individuals of nonmodel species. Utilizing genotype data in the absence of a reference genome, however, presents a number of challenges. One major challenge is the trade-off between splitting alleles at a single locus into separate clusters (loci), creating inflated homozygosity, and lumping multiple loci into a single contig (locus), creating artefacts and inflated heterozygosity. This issue has been addressed primarily through the use of similarity cut-offs in sequence clustering. Here, two commonly employed postclustering filtering methods (read depth and excess heterozygosity) used to identify incorrectly assembled loci are compared with haplotyping, another postclustering filtering approach. Simulated and empirical data sets were used to demonstrate that each of the three methods separately identified incorrectly assembled loci; more optimal results were achieved when the three methods were applied in combination. The results confirmed that including incorrectly assembled loci in population-genetic data sets inflates estimates of heterozygosity and deflates estimates of population divergence. Additionally, at low levels of population divergence, physical linkage between SNPs within a locus created artificial clustering in analyses that assume markers are independent. Haplotyping SNPs within a locus effectively neutralized the physical linkage issue without having to thin data to a single SNP per locus. We introduce a Perl script that haplotypes polymorphisms, using data from single or paired-end reads, and identifies potentially problematic loci.},
