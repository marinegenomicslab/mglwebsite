The smalltooth sawfish is critically endangered and a team has been tasked with facilitating recovery in the United States. Recovery requires understanding the magnitude of decline in population (census) size over time, but no such estimates of current or historical census size exist. This project uses cutting-edge genetic techniques to provide the recovery team with estimates of current and baseline population size (using a CKMR framework), while building tools for future monitoring. The results will be used to assess recovery, inform conservation actions, and enhance legal protections.
