 abstract = {Two sharks, visually identified in the field as young-of-the-year (YOY) scalloped hammerhead \textitSphyrna lewini, were identified as great hammerhead \textitSphyrna mokarran based on nuclear-encoded single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequences of mtDNA. Individuals were captured and released in Bulls Bay, SC, and Saint Joseph Bay, FL, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. These findings indicate \textitS. mokarran may be pupping in or around these areas and highlight new regions that may be a productive focus for future research on early life history of \textitS. mokarran.},
