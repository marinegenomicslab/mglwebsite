abstract: 'Genetic diversity was assessed in samples of cultured Atlantic salmon,
  Salmo salar L., obtained from facilities in Chile between 2005 and 2010, a period
  of time during which the infectious pathogens Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus,
  Caligus rogercresseyi (sea lice), and Piscirickettsia salmonis (salmon rickettsial
  syndrome) were common. Two panels of microsatellite markers were utilized: one with
  microsatellites with no known gene associations (neutral) and one featuring microsatellites
  linked to putative immune-related genes (immune-related). Allelic richness and gene
  diversity across samples were significantly greater in neutral loci as compared
  to immune-related loci. Both diversity measures were homogeneous among samples for
  immune-related loci and heterogeneous among samples for neutral loci. Immune-related
  loci were identified as FST outliers in pairwise comparisons of samples at a 10-fold
  higher frequency than neutral loci. These results indicate that neutral and immune-related
  portions of the Atlantic salmon genome may have differed in response to the gauntlet
  of pathogens and that monitoring of specific, well characterized immune-related
  loci as well as neutral loci in cultured species could be useful when disease control
  and prevention is a goal.'
