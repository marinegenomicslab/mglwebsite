abstract: Sex-biased dispersal is expected to homogenize nuclear genetic variation
  relative to variation in genetic material inherited through the philopatric sex.
  When site ﬁdelity occurs across a heterogeneous environment, local selective regimes
  may alter this pattern. We assessed spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded,
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequences of the mitochondrial control
  region in bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female
  philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic patterns
  of mtDNA haplotypes and putatively neutral SNPs conﬁrmed female philopatry and male-mediated
  gene ﬂow along the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier
  SNP loci were identiﬁed; alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures
  of latitude-associated selection. Our results indicate that in species with sex-biased
  dispersal, philopatry can facilitate sorting of locally adaptive variation, with
  the dispersing sex facilitating movement of potentially adaptive variation among
  locations and environments.
