<!-- Many freshwater fishes endemic to the major and minor spring-fed tributaries of the lower Rio Grande within Texas exhibit small, highly fragmented distributions and are a priority for conservation by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Several of these species (e.g., Etheostoma grahami, Dionda argentosa, D. diaboli, Cyprinella proserpina, and Notropis megalops) have distributions that fall almost entirely within two Texan native fish conservations areas (NFCAs), the Devils and Pecos River NFCAs. The small geographic ranges of each of the five species are highly fragmented and have undergone contraction within recent years in response to human activities, including (but not limited to) water extraction and the introduction of non-natives. Conservation genomics will involve next-generation sequencing techniques allowing for a robust assessment of standing genetic diversity and geneflow for each species, providing crucial information for future management and conservation planning. -->
