	abstract = {Restriction-site associated {DNA} sequencing ({RADseq}) has become a powerful and useful approach for population genomics. Currently, no software exists that utilizes both paired-end reads from {RADseq} data to efficiently produce populationinformative variant calls, especially for non-model organisms with large effective population sizes and high levels of genetic polymorphism. {dDocent} is an analysis pipeline with a user-friendly, command-line interface designed to process individually barcoded {RADseq} data (with double cut sites) into informative {SNPs}/Indels for population-level analyses. The pipeline, written in {BASH}, uses data reduction techniques and other stand-alone software packages to perform quality trimming and adapter removal, de novo assembly of {RAD} loci, read mapping, {SNP} and Indel calling, and baseline data filtering. Double-digest {RAD} data from population pairings of three different marine fishes were used to compare {dDocent} with Stacks, the first generally available, widely used pipeline for analysis of {RADseq} data. {dDocent} consistently identified more {SNPs} shared across greater numbers of individuals and with higher levels of coverage. This is due to the fact that {dDocent} quality trims instead of filtering, incorporates both forward and reverse reads (including reads with {INDEL} polymorphisms) in assembly, mapping, and {SNP} calling. The pipeline and a comprehensive user guide can be found at http://{dDocent}.wordpress.com.},

	abstract = {Spawning patterns and reproductive variance of Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus dams and sires at two restoration enhancement facilities in Texas were assessed across a spawning year by using parentage analysis based on 12 variable microsatellite loci. In total, 72.6\% of all dams and sires contributed to at least one spawning event, although in contrasting patterns. Across all spawning events assayed, more sires contributed to each spawn, on average, than did dams; dams had considerably higher variance in reproductive success than sires. Dams alternatively had a higher average contribution to the number of progeny from a single spawn but also a much higher variance in the number of progeny produced per spawn. The variation in the number of progeny produced per dam and per sire and the number of actual mating combinations led to an average reduction of 64.3\% in the genetic effective population size (Ne) per spawn relative to the maximum Ne that would be expected if (1) all possible dam × sire mating combinations occurred at random and (2) all families contained an equal number of progeny. Averaged over all spawns, the actual number of mating combinations accounted for approximately 83.6\% of the total reduction in Ne, while variation in family size accounted for 16.4\% of the total reduction in Ne. Results from this and other studies indicate that reductions in Ne of hatchery- or farm-raised progeny stem primarily from noncontributing dams, suggesting that periodic identiﬁcation and removal of low-contributing dams from broodﬁsh stocks constitute a critical step toward maximizing the Ne of hatchery offspring used in restoration enhancement.},

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity and/or inferred barriers to gene ﬂow, based on microsatellites and/or {mtDNA}, revealed the occurrence of ﬁve genetic populations localized to ﬁve geographic regions: the southeastern U.S Atlantic coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the western Gulf of Mexico, Bay of Campeche in the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas. Pairwise estimates of genetic divergence between sharks in the Bahamas and those in all other localities were more than an order of magnitude higher than between pairwise comparisons involving the other localities. Demographic modelling indicated that sharks in all ﬁve regions diverged after the last glacial maximum and, except for the Bahamas, experienced post-glacial, population expansion. The patterns of genetic variation also suggest that the southern Gulf of Mexico may have served as a glacial refuge and source for the expansion. Results of the study demonstrate that barriers to gene ﬂow and historical genetic demography contributed to contemporary patterns of population structure in a coastal migratory species living in an otherwise continuous marine habitat. The results also indicate that for many marine species, failure to properly characterize barriers in terms of levels of contemporary gene ﬂow could in part be due to inferences based solely on equilibrium assumptions. This could lead to erroneous conclusions regarding levels of connectivity in species of conservation concern.},

Initial tests ({FST}-based, hierarchical {AMOVA}) of spatial genetic homogeneity within and between regions were non-signiﬁcant, consistent with a single population or stock of red snapper in the Atlantic and Gulf. Inferences derived from other statistical approaches were consistent with genetic and/or demographic differences within and between the two regions. The estimated, average, long-term migration rate between the two regions (0.27\%) was well less than the 10\% rate below which populations can respond independently to environmental perturbation. Comparisons of global estimates of average, long-term effective size ({NeLT}) with estimates from individual sample localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf. Future genetics studies and other work on red snapper in both the Atlantic and Gulf should include approaches to identify demographically independent units within each region and assess their size, patterns of connectivity, and contribution to the ﬁshery. Monitoring global and/or local effective size also should be considered.},

	abstract = {Identiﬁcation of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently, species-speciﬁc management of smoothhound shark resources is difﬁcult when multiple species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identiﬁcation and distribution of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using sequences of mitochondrial {DNA}, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data. Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded {ND}-2 sequences and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were identiﬁed as Smooth Dogﬁsh Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi, and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests of species-speciﬁc means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude, and month) at capture indicated signiﬁcant differences among the three species with respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogﬁsh is found in deeper waters than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow waters. A diagnostic key for the ﬁeld identiﬁcation of adult specimens of each species is provided.},

We assessed spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded, single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and sequences of the mitochondrial control region in bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic patterns of {mtDNA} haplotypes and putatively neutral {SNPs} conﬁrmed female philopatry and male-mediated gene ﬂow along the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier {SNP} loci were identiﬁed; alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures of latitude-associated selection. Our results indicate that in species with sex-biased dispersal, philopatry can facilitate sorting of locally adaptive variation, with the dispersing sex facilitating movement of potentially adaptive variation among locations and environments.},

Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in microsatellite allele distributions was detected among all localities except between the two in the Atlantic. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in {mtDNA} haplotypes was not detected, a result likely due to extremely low {mtDNA} diversity. The genetic discontinuities combined with seasonal movement patterns, a patchy distribution of appropriate nursery habitat, the apparent absence of sex-biased gene ﬂow, and the occurrence of mating in the vicinity of nursery areas, suggest that both male and female ﬁnetooth sharks display regional philopatry to discrete nursery areas. Global and local tests of neutrality, using {mtDNA} haplotypes, and demographic model testing, using Approximate Bayesian Computation of microsatellite alleles, supported a range-wide expansion of ﬁnetooth sharks into {US} waters occurring less than 9000 years ago. These ﬁndings add to the growing number of studies in a variety of coastally distributed marine ﬁshes documenting signiﬁcant barriers to gene ﬂow around peninsular Florida and in the eastern Gulf.

Significant genetic heterogeneity was detected between the two adult samples, separated by {\textasciitilde}600 km, and at spatial scales less than five kilometers among samples of  {YOY}. Genetic differences between {YOY} samples and between {YOY} samples and adult samples were not associated with geographic distance, and a genome scan revealed no evidence of loci under selection. Estimates of the effective number of breeders, allelic richness, and relatedness within {YOY} samples were not consistent with sweepstakes recruitment. Instead, the data demonstrate, at least within one recruitment season, that multiple pulses of recruits originate from distinct groups of spawning adults, even at small spatial scales. For exploited species with this type of recruitment pattern, protection of spawning adults over wide geographic areas may be critical for ensuring productivity and stability of the fishery by maintaining larval supply and connectivity.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of reduced-representation genomic libraries provides a powerful methodology for genotyping thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) among individuals of nonmodel species. Utilizing genotype data in the absence of a reference genome, however, presents a number of challenges. One major challenge is the trade-off between splitting alleles at a single locus into separate clusters (loci), creating inﬂated homozygosity, and lumping multiple loci into a single contig (locus), creating artefacts and inﬂated heterozygosity. This issue has been addressed primarily through the use of similarity cut-offs in sequence clustering. Here, two commonly employed, postclustering ﬁltering methods (read depth and excess heterozygosity) used to identify incorrectly assembled loci are compared with haplotyping, another postclustering ﬁltering approach. Simulated and empirical data sets were used to demonstrate that each of the three methods separately identiﬁed incorrectly assembled loci; more optimal results were achieved when the three methods were applied in combination. The results conﬁrmed that including incorrectly assembled loci in population-genetic data sets inﬂates estimates of heterozygosity and deﬂates estimates of population divergence. Additionally, at low levels of population divergence, physical linkage between {SNPs} within a locus created artiﬁcial clustering in analyses that assume markers are independent. Haplotyping {SNPs} within a locus effectively neutralized the physical linkage issue without having to thin data to a single {SNP} per locus. We introduce a Perl script that haplotypes polymorphisms, using data from single or paired-end reads, and identiﬁes potentially problematic loci.},

	abstract = {Background: Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, historically support a substantial fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southern United States. Low year-class strengths over the past few years in the western Gulf of Mexico have raised concern that spawning stocks may be overfished. Current management of the resource includes releasing hatchery-raised juveniles to restock bays and estuaries; additionally, there is a growing interest in the potential for commercial aquaculture of the species. Currently, genomic resources for southern flounder do not exist. Here, we used two hatchery-reared families and double-digest, restriction-site-associated {DNA} ({ddRAD}) sequencing to create a reduced-representation genomic library consisting of several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) located throughout the genome.
Results: The relative position of each {SNP}-containing locus was determined to create a high-density genetic map spanning the 24 linkage groups of the southern flounder genome. The consensus map was used to identify regions of shared synteny between southern flounder and seven other fish species for which genome assemblies are available. Finally, syntenic blocks were used to localize genes identified from transcripts in European flounder as potentially being involved in ecotoxicological and osmoregulatory responses, as well as {QTLs} associated with growth and disease resistance in Japanese flounder, on the southern flounder linkage map.
Conclusions: The information provided by the linkage map will enrich restoration efforts by providing a foundation for interpreting spatial genetic variation within the species, ultimately furthering an understanding of the adaptive potential and resilience of southern flounder to future changes in local environmental conditions. Further, the map will facilitate the use of genetic markers to enhance restoration and commercial aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Sequencing reduced‐representation libraries of restriction site‐associated {DNA} ({RADseq}) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of {RADseq} data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of {SNP} data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to {RADseq} methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous {SNP} calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four {RAD} data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.},

Analyses of neutral and outlier loci revealed three genetically distinct regional clusters: one in the Atlantic and two in the northern Gulf. Divergence in neutral loci indicated gradual genetic change and followed a linear pattern of isolation by distance. Divergence in outlier loci was at least an order of magnitude greater than divergence in neutral loci, and divergence between the regions in the Gulf was twice that of divergence between other regions. Discordance in patterns of genetic divergence between outlier and neutral loci is consistent with the hypothesis that the former reflects adaptive responses to environmental factors that vary on regional scales, while the latter largely reflects drift processes. Differences in basic habitat, initiated by glacial retreat and perpetuated by contemporary oceanic and atmospheric forces interacting with the geomorphology of the northern Gulf, followed by selection, appear to have led to reduced gene flow among red drum across the northern Gulf, reinforcing differences accrued during isolation and resulting in continued divergence across the genome. This same dynamic also may pertain to other coastal or nearshore fishes (18 species in 14 families) where genetically or morphologically defined sister taxa occur in the three regions.},

To understand how South Florida functions as a barrier for blacknose shark, a highly migratory species that has genetically diverged Atlantic and Gulf populations, patterns of genetic variation were assessed in 212 individuals sampled from the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and Florida Keys at 2213 nuclear-encoded {SNP}-containing loci. Results support divergence between the Gulf and Atlantic ({FST} {\textasciitilde} 0.002, P {\textless} 0.05), and 51 individuals caught in the Keys were assigned to the Gulf, as compared to only two individuals that assigned to the Atlantic, indicating that Florida Keys is largely composed of Gulf individuals. Further, two to three migrants were identified, all of which were Gulf individuals captured in the Atlantic. The results indicate that South Florida does not prevent individual movement between the Gulf and Atlantic and that the Keys may be a seasonal mixing zone. However, the Gulf and Atlantic remain genetically independent, suggesting that region-specific reproductive behavior/compatibility, or aspects of movement ecology, such as swimming energetics or temperature-driven interannual variability in migratory range, may maintain divergence rather than a physical barrier in South Florida.},

	abstract = {Essential habitat is required for a given species to complete its lifecycle and includes habitat for breeding, feeding, and growth. Estuaries provide essential habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based, gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including a shark, Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species, Hypanus americanus, that were not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species, Carcharhinus brevipinna, comprised 45\% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1\% of the total elasmobranch catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenile Carcharhinus brevipinna and Sphyrna lewini were observed across multiple years and in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled estuaries functions as a nursery. Although putative nurseries for these species have been identified elsewhere in the world, estuaries serving as nursery grounds in the western Gulf of Mexico are not well described.},

These alterations have disproportionately impacted the pelagic broadcast spawning guild of minnows (pelagophils). Several Rio Grande endemic pelagophils, including the co-occurring Rio Grande Shiner (Notropis jemezanus) and Speckled Chub (Macrhybopsis aestivalis), have experienced dramatic recent range-wide declines yet have slipped under the radar of conservation efforts. The status of N. jemezanus and M. aestivalis in the Rio Grande and Pecos River was evaluated and standing genetic variation was characterized. Genetic evidence indicates that populations of both species found in the Rio Grande and Pecos River are genetically distinct. Additionally, 159 outlier loci were identified in M. aestivalis suggesting possible local adaptation in the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations. Though range-wide genetic data are limited, N. jemezanus populations in both rivers harbor considerable genetic diversity. Mitochondrial data from both taxa are consistent with a history of secondary contact between formerly isolated populations with deeply divergent haplotypes found within the Rio Grande and Pecos River populations of N. jemezanus and within the Rio Grande population of M. aestivalis. Extensive survey efforts in the lower Rio Grande and its tributaries in Texas document significant range contraction and near extirpation of N. jemezanus from this part of the basin; highlighting the need for immediate action to protect the species.},

In this study, the distribution of Carolina hammerheads in waters of the United States off the east coast (U.S. Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was examined and their abundance relative to scalloped hammerheads assessed by genetically identifying 1231 individuals using diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both species were found in the U.S. Atlantic, where 27 \% of individuals were Carolina hammerheads, but only scalloped hammerheads were identified in the Gulf. In Bulls Bay, {SC}, a well-known hammerhead nursery, assessment of relative abundance from May to September showed scalloped hammerheads were more abundant May-June and Carolina hammerheads more abundant July-September. Results of this study suggest Carolina hammerheads have a spatially limited distribution in the western North Atlantic and highlight the importance of Bulls Bay as a nursery for the species. In addition, the results suggest Carolina hammerheads may comprise a non-trivial proportion of what is considered the U.S. Atlantic scalloped hammerhead stock and should be considered in future decisions regarding management of the hammerhead complex.},

Here, 4,122 {SNP}-containing loci were used to assess structure in southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) sampled across its range in the {US} Atlantic Ocean (Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and relationships among components of genomic variation and spatial and environmental variables were assessed across estuarine population samples in the Gulf. While hierarchical {AmovA} revealed significant heterogeneity within and between the Atlantic and Gulf, pairwise comparisons between samples within ocean basins demonstrated that all significant heterogeneity occurred within the Gulf. The distribution of Tajima's D estimated at a genome-wide scale differed significantly from equilibrium in all estuaries, with more negative values occurring in the Gulf. Components of genomic variation were significantly associated with environmental variables describing individual estuaries, and environment explained a larger component of variation than spatial proximity. Overall, results suggest that there is genetic spatial autocorrelation caused by shared larval sources for proximal nurseries (migration/drift), but that it is modified by environmentally driven differentiation (selection). This leads to conflicting signals in different parts of the genome and creates patterns of divergence that do not correspond to paradigms of strong local directional selection.},

Consequently, it has been the focus of intensive ﬁsheries research for more than  years. Here, we present a genomic analysis of population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico ({GOM}) alongside a synoptic view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and {GOM} stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the {GOM}. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the {GOM} display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously.},

	abstract = {The use of {DNA} barcoding in fish diet studies is becoming more widespread, but the effect of prey digestion on barcoding accuracy has been poorly studied. We conducted a series of controlled feeding experiments, with red lionfish (Pterois volitans) as predators and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) as prey, designed to test the effect of digestion time (12–42 h), prey item (sample) preservation (inside versus outside stomach), and sample preparation (washed versus unwashed) on {DNA} barcoding classification accuracy. Competitive interactions occurred between lionfish and killifish {DNA} during {PCR} amplification when universal {COI} primers were utilized; thus, primers were designed that matched the same priming site in both killifish and lionfish {DNA}. The proportion of amplified killifish {DNA} relative to lionfish {DNA} per sample was estimated using multiplex quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) and shown to decrease with longer digestion times, especially when samples were retained within lionfish stomachs for preservation. The effects of digestion and preservation method on amplifiable {DNA} resulted in significant effects on barcoding accuracy, resulting in erroneous identification of the predator (i.e., self-{DNA}) for nearly 25\% of samples. Removing prey from predator stomachs prior to preservation significantly increased the proportion of amplified killifish {DNA} from samples, and enhanced barcoding accuracy. Overall, study results have important implications for the probability of false negatives for prey items, as well as false positives for {selfDNA}, when utilizing barcoding to characterize piscine diet. Results also highlight the need to conduct more method validation research given the increasing prevalence of {DNA} barcoding as a means to identify specific prey items in fish diet studies.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) have the potential to conserve biodiversity and improve fishery sustainability, but their efficacy depends on sound design and implementation, which requires an understanding of connectivity among reserves and between reserves and fished areas. Most studies of connectivity involving reserves focus on fishes with characteristics atypical for exploited species, making the results less applicable to fisheries management. Here, patterns of genomic diversity were assessed within and among geographic samples of juvenile of silk snapper, Lutjanus vivanus, collected in protected and fished areas on the western coast of Puerto Rico. The results indicate significant variation in spatiotemporal genetic recruitment patterns, with the two {MPAs} located off the shelf having partially decoupled recruitment processes from sites on the shelf. Spatial autocorrelation was found at distances less than 20 km within years, but the degree and pattern of spatial structure differed across years, suggesting that recruitment along the west coast of Puerto Rico originates from semi-independent units of spawners whose contribution varies in space and time. The results suggest that while {MPAs} may work to supplement fisheries where recruitment is spatiotemporally predictable, in species for which adult contribution is variable in space and time, other management strategies should be explored as well.},

	abstract = {Stock enhancement is an increasingly popular fisheries management strategy in which high mortality of early life history stages is circumvented by rearing juveniles in controlled or semi-controlled conditions. While the success of such programs is generally measured by the number of stocked individuals or individuals recruiting to the wild populations, an important consideration is minimizing impacts to the genetic diversity of wild populations by maximizing the number of breeders contributing to stocked progeny. The contribution of individual breeders is impacted both by variance in spawning success among adults and variance in mortality among families during grow-out. To disentangle the effects that these sources of variance have on parental contribution, red drum broodfish participating in three spawning events at the {TWPD} Marine Development Center were genotyped at several thousand {SNP}-containing loci along with their progeny. Progeny were sampled at three time points; shortly after introduction to grow-out ponds (T1), approximately midway through grow-out (T2), and as fingerlings during harvesting to be stocked in bays (T3). Using composite genotypes, progeny were assigned to parents to determine the reproductive success of individual broodfish at T1, T2, and T3 and to identify changes in the effective number of breeders (Nb) during rearing in grow-out ponds. Relationships between reproductive success and broodfish-specific parameters, including age and condition when introduced to the hatchery, time spent in the hatchery, and estimated age at spawning were assessed. Finally, associations between components of genomic variation in progeny from each sampling period and environmental parameters including salinity, {pH}, temperature, and dissolved oxygen present in the grow-out ponds, were identified. The results indicate that initial variance in reproductive success, including the failure of some individuals to spawn successfully, has the greatest impact on Nb. Mortality during growth had a relatively small impact on Nb and, in some cases, led to increases in Nb. Further, both family and environmental conditions in the outdoor rearing ponds significantly shaped the genetic diversity of stocked yearlings. Overall, these findings indicate that outdoor rearing in a semicontrolled environment exposes progeny to a range of environmental conditions across the season, which appears to play a role in maintaining and sometimes increasing Nb.},

	abstract = {Understanding how interactions among microevolutionary forces generate genetic population structure of exploited species is vital to the implementation of management policies that facilitate persistence. Philopatry displayed by many coastal shark species can impact gene flow and facilitate selection, and has direct implications for the spatial scales of management. Here, genetic structure of the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) was examined using a mixed‐marker approach employing mitochondrial control region sequences and 4339 {SNP}‐containing loci generated using {ddRAD}‐Seq. Genetic variation was assessed among young‐of‐the‐year sampled in 11 sites in waters of the United States in the western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico. Spatial and environmental analyses detected 68 nuclear loci putatively under selection, enabling separate assessments of neutral and adaptive genetic structure. Both mitochondrial and neutral {SNP} data indicated three genetically distinct units—the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and western Gulf—that align with regional stocks and suggest regional philopatry by males and females. Heterogeneity at loci putatively under selection, associated with temperature and salinity, was observed among sites within Gulf units, suggesting local adaptation. Furthermore, five pairs of siblings were identified in the same site across timescales corresponding with female reproductive cycles. This indicates that females re‐used a site for parturition, which has the potential to facilitate the sorting of adaptive variation among neighbouring sites. The results demonstrate differential impacts of microevolutionary forces at varying spatial scales and highlight the importance of conserving essential habitats to maintain sources of adaptive variation that may buffer species against environmental change.},

To better understand patterns and timing of diversification, geological events can be coupled with time calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses to infer major drivers of diversification. Phylogenetic relationships among members of Sphoeroides, a genus of four toothed pufferfishes (Tetraodontiformes: Tetraodontidae) which are found nearly exclusively in the New World (eastern Pacific and western Atlantic), were reconstructed using sequences from ultra-conserved {DNA} elements, nuclear markers with clear homology among many vertebrate taxa. Hypotheses derived from concatenated maximum-likelihood and species tree summary methods support a paraphyletic Sphoeroides, with Colomesus deeply nested within the genus. Analyses also revealed S. pachygaster, a pelagic species with a cosmopolitan distribution, as the sister taxon to the remainder of Sphoeroides and recovered distinct lineages within S. pachygaster, indicating that this cosmopolitan species may represent a species complex. Ancestral range reconstruction may suggest the genus colonized the New World through the eastern Pacific before diversifying in the western Atlantic, though date estimates for these events are uncertain due to the lack of reliable fossil record for the genus.},

One of these turtles, the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), is of concern within the United States, but surveying potential estuarine habitat for the presence of the species requires high levels of time and effort. Here a species-specific, probe-based {qPCR} assay for identifying terrapin {DNA} from environmental {DNA} ({eDNA}) is described. To expand the utility of this tool, the assay was designed to allow for potential detection of at least 19 other pond turtles taxa and the utility was tested by designing a second species-specific probe for red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) with a different fluorophore, which can be used simultaneously with the terrapin probe to detect either species. Probes were found to be species-specific and effective at detecting low levels of {DNA} for the target species, the diamondback terrapin (10 fg/µL) and the red-eared slider (100 fg/µL) in laboratory conditions. The assay also showed species-specific detection in environmental samples taken from field locations where one species or the other were known to reside. Through citizen science approaches, this assay could be used for discovering novel terrapin habitats, monitoring invasive red-eared slider populations or surveying other emydids, with species-specific probes, at a fraction of the cost of traditional surveys.},

Here, patterns of variation within and among samples of the mouthbrooding gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus, Family Ariidae) captured in the U.S. Atlantic and throughout the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed using genomics to generate neutral and non‐neutral {SNP} data sets. Because genomic resources are lacking for ariids, linkage disequilibrium network analysis was used to examine patterns of putatively adaptive variation. Finally, historical demographic parameters were estimated from site frequency spectra. The results show four differentiated groups, corresponding to the (1) U.S. Atlantic, and the (2) northeastern, (3) northwestern, and (4) southern Gulf of Mexico. The non‐neutral data presented two contrasting signals of structure, one due to increases in diversity moving west to east and north to south, and another to increased heterozygosity in the Atlantic. Demographic analysis suggested that recently reduced long‐term effective population size in the Atlantic is likely an important driver of patterns of genetic variation and is consistent with a known reduction in population size potentially due to an epizootic. Overall, patterns of genetic variation resemble that of other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats as nurseries, regardless of the presence/absence of a larval phase, supporting the idea that adult/juvenile behavior and habitat are important predictors of contemporary patterns of genetic structure. Gafftopsail catfish show high levels of genetic structuring across their distribution in the U.S., Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Non‐neutral data present two contrasting signals of structure and historical demography is likely an important driver of patterns of neutral and non‐neutral genetic variation. Results of this study are similar to what is seen in other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats as nurseries, but gafftopsail catfish lack a larval phase, supporting the idea that adult/juvenile behavior and habitat use are important predictors of contemporary patterns of genetic structure.},

Traditional vertebrae-based age estimation in elasmobranchs can be costly, time intensive, of low accuracy, and is by necessity lethal. Herein, epigenetic clocks were developed for an elasmobranch, the cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), using aquarium-born individuals (n = 42) with known dates of birth (age range: 7–7,878 days or 0–21 years) and two tissue types (fin clips and whole blood) that can be sampled in a relatively non-invasive manner. Enzymatically-converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ECrad-seq) was used to identify CpG sites that exhibited age-correlated DNA methylation. The epigenetic clocks developed were highly accurate (mean absolute error, MAE, < 0.75 years) and precise (R^2 > 0.98). Age-associated CpG sites were identified across tissues, and a multi-tissue clock was also highly accurate (MAE < 1 year) and precise (R^2 = 0.97). Using the developed fin clip clock, three wild-caught individuals of unknown age but managed in aquariums for > 22 years were predicted to be 22.10–23.49 years old. Overall, the results have important implications for future epigenetic clock development and noninvasive age estimation in elasmobranchs.},
