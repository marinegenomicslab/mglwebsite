Katie joined the Marine Genomics Lab in July 2024. Her research interests include understanding marine animalsâ€™ physiological responses to human-caused changes in the oceans, such as pollution, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. 
 
Katie received her BS from Miami University of Ohio in May 2024. While working on her undergraduate degree, she pursued summer internships at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium in 2022 studying manatee populations. Additionally, she spent time at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2023 studying microplastic ingestion in rainbow trout. She also participated in a research dive trip analyzing the spread of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease with nonprofit Reef Expeditions in September 2023 and studied tropical marine biology in Costa Rica in January 2024. After graduating, she joined the Marine Genomics Lab to strengthen her lab skills and narrow down her interests before pursuing a graduate degree in the field.
