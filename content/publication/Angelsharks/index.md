abstract: While dorsal-ventrally compressed chondrichthyans are among the most imperiled fishes in the world, there is still limited knowledge of the biology of many of these species, even in well-studied
   ocean basins. In the western North Atlantic Ocean,
  the population structure of the Atlantic angel shark
  (Squatina dumeril) is not fully understood; therefore,
  the portioning of genetic variation was assessed
  among individuals caught along the east coast of the
  United States (Atlantic) and on the northern Gulf of
  Mexico (Gulf) using reduced representation genomics
  and mitochondrial sequencing. Three distinct groups
  were delineated with nuclear data, the Atlantic, the
  eastern Gulf, and the western Gulf, along boundaries
  described by previous research. Mitochondrial
  data only resolved two groups, with the western
  Gulf separated from the eastern Gulf and Atlantic
  combined. Demographic modeling suggested that
  the Atlantic population separated from a single Gulf
  population which subsequently split into eastern and
  western populations. Additionally, there was evidence
  that adjacent populations experienced gene flow
  after splitting, which may explain the incongruence
  between results based on nuclear and mtCR data.
  Correlations between environmental variables and
  allele frequencies at 873 loci indicated potential local
  adaptation. Therefore, the preservation of all three
  groups is necessary for the conservation of long-term adaptive variation important for species persistence.
