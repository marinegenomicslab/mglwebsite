 abstract = {Cutting-edge DNA methylation-based epigenetic aging techniques were applied to Gulf of Mexico northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus; n = 10; 1–26 years old) and red grouper (Epinephelus morio; n = 10; 2–14 years old). Bisulﬁteconverted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was used to identify CpG sites (cytosines followed by guanines) that exhibit age-correlated DNA methylation, and species-speciﬁc epigenetic clocks developed from hundreds of CpG sites in each species showed strong agreement between predicted and otolith-derived age (r2 \textgreater 0.99 for both species). Results suggest epigenetic age estimation could provide an accurate and efﬁcient approach to mass-aging ﬁshes in a non-invasive manner.},
