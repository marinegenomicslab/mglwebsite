abstract: Essential habitat is required for a given species to complete its lifecycle
  and includes habitat for breeding, feeding, and growth. Estuaries provide essential
  habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based,
  gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting
  Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal
  scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains
  uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey
  open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch
  nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including
  a shark, Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species, Hypanus americanus, that were
  not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species, Carcharhinus
  brevipinna, comprised 45% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys
  of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1% of the total elasmobranch
  catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of
  the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal
  inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenile
  Carcharhinus brevipinna and Sphyrna lewini were observed across multiple years and
  in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled
  estuaries functions as a nursery. Although putative nurseries for these species
  have been identified elsewhere in the world, estuaries serving as nursery grounds
  in the western Gulf of Mexico are not well described.
