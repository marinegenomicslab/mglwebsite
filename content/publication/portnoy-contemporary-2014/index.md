abstract: 'Patterns of population structure and historical genetic demography of blacknose
  sharks in the western North Atlantic Ocean were assessed using variation in nuclearencoded
  microsatellites and sequences of mitochondrial (mt)DNA. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity
  and/or inferred barriers to gene ﬂow, based on microsatellites and/or mtDNA, revealed
  the occurrence of ﬁve genetic populations localized to ﬁve geographic regions: the
  southeastern U.S Atlantic coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the western Gulf of
  Mexico, Bay of Campeche in the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas. Pairwise
  estimates of genetic divergence between sharks in the Bahamas and those in all other
  localities were more than an order of magnitude higher than between pairwise comparisons
  involving the other localities. Demographic modelling indicated that sharks in all
  ﬁve regions diverged after the last glacial maximum and, except for the Bahamas,
  experienced post-glacial, population expansion. The patterns of genetic variation
  also suggest that the southern Gulf of Mexico may have served as a glacial refuge
  and source for the expansion. Results of the study demonstrate that barriers to
  gene ﬂow and historical genetic demography contributed to contemporary patterns
  of population structure in a coastal migratory species living in an otherwise continuous
  marine habitat. The results also indicate that for many marine species, failure
  to properly characterize barriers in terms of levels of contemporary gene ﬂow could
  in part be due to inferences based solely on equilibrium assumptions. This could
  lead to erroneous conclusions regarding levels of connectivity in species of conservation
  concern.'
