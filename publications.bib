	abstract = {Age data are essential for estimating life history parameters and are thus critical for population assessment, management, and conservation. Traditional vertebrae-based age estimation in elasmobranchs can be costly, time intensive, of low accuracy, and is by necessity lethal. Herein, epigenetic clocks were developed for an elasmobranch, the cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), using aquarium-born individuals (n = 42) with known dates of birth (age range: 7−7,878 days or 0−21 years) and two tissue types (fin clips and whole blood) that can be sampled in a relatively non-invasive manner. Enzymatically-converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ECrad-seq) was used to identify CpG sites that exhibited age-correlated DNA methylation. The epigenetic clocks developed were highly accurate (mean absolute error, MAE, {\textless} 0.75 years) and precise (R2 {\textgreater} 0.98). Age-associated CpG sites were identified across tissues, and a multi-tissue clock was also highly accurate (MAE {\textless} 1 year) and precise (R2 = 0.97). Using the developed fin clip clock, three wild-caught individuals of unknown age but managed in aquariums for {\textgreater} 22 years were predicted to be 22.10−23.49 years old. Overall, the results have important implications for future epigenetic clock development and noninvasive age estimation in elasmobranchs.},

	abstract = {The presence of cryptic species can hinder effective conservation planning and implementation, as has been the case for speciose groups of freshwater fishes that are difficult to differentiate due to conserved morphologies. The West Texas shiner Notropis megalops and the Texas shiner Notropis amabilis are a cryptic pair of leuciscids (minnows) that co-occur in spring-fed tributaries of the Rio Grande in Texas and Mexico. Both N. megalops and N. amabilis are listed as Species of Greatest Conservation Need by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Notropis amabilis is widespread and listed as apparently secure by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department whereas N. megalops has a very limited distribution and has not been ranked by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department because of data deficiency. Morphological differences between these species have been described; however, proper identification in situ remains problematic. Furthermore, given their range of overlap there is potential for hybridization, and limited genetic data have been collected comparing the species. Therefore, reduced representation genomic and mitochondrial sequencing data were used to reassess the distinctness of the species, screen for hybridization, and characterize their relative frequencies throughout their range of overlap. Genomic analyses recovered two distinct genetic groups corresponding to the species (F'CT = 0.89) with no evidence of admixture or introgression. The species were found to co-occur at three sampling locations, two in the Devils River and one in the Pecos, but not in equal frequencies. Overall, these results provide data and tools for further research on N. megalops needed for accurate conservation policies and management practices.},

Notropis oxyrhynchus and Notropis buccula are two shiners found only in the upper Brazos River basin in Texas, USA and listed as endangered due to contracted habitat. The complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced for two vouchered specimens for each species; Notropis oxyrhynchus having a total mitogenome length of 16,711 bp and N. buccula having a total mitogenome length 16685–16686 bp, with both including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis supports previous hypotheses regarding placement of these species.},
