abstract: "Age estimates are essential for ﬁsheries assessment and management, but
  deepwater (textgreater200 m) ﬁshes are often difficult to age using traditional
  techniques. Therefore, age-predictive epigenetic clocks were developed for a model
  deepwater reef ﬁsh, blackbelly roseﬁsh Helicolenus dactylopterus, using two tissue
  types (ﬁn clips and muscle; n = 61 individuals; 9−60 years) and \x0214C-validated
  consensus age estimates. The inﬂuence of biological information (length and sex)
  on epigenetic clock accuracy, and the potential for developing a multi-tissue clock,
  were also assessed. Bisulﬁte-converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
  (bsRADseq) was used to identify CpG sites (cytosines followed by guanines) exhibiting
  age-correlated DNA methylation, and epigenetic clocks showed strong agreement (R2
  textgreater 0.98) between predicted and consensus ages. Including length and sex
  data enhanced accuracy and precision (R2 textgreater 0.99; mean absolute error textless
  1 year). Age-associated CpG sites were identiﬁed across tissues, but a multi-tissue
  clock performed poorly relative to single-tissue clocks. Overall, results demonstrate
  that accurate and precise epigenetic clocks can be developed for deepwater ﬁshes,
  and the inclusion of biological information may enhance clock accuracy and precision."
