Many fishes, like snappers and triggerfish, have genetic sex determination, while other species change sex during their life cycle, such as groupers or wrasses. Currently, determining the sex of individuals requires the use of lethal methods. This study aims to use a variety of genomic techniques, such as whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing to characterize molecular differences between the sexes of three commercially important species: red snapper, gray triggerfish, and gag grouper. The data will be used to develop sex-specific markers for each species as a tool for accurate and non-lethal sex idenitficationidentification.
