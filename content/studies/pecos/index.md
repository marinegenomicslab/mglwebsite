<!-- The Pecos pupfish, Cyprinodon pecosensisÂ¸ is an imperiled freshwater fish, endemic to the Rio Grande drainage of the southern United States in New Mexico and Texas. This species is of conservation concern due to potential habitat loss and degradation, low population numbers, and potential interactions with the introduced sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus. Due to the extreme vulnerability of narrowly distributed species of Cyprinodon, assessing levels of genetic diversity is essential for guiding population conservation and management decisions. Information for this assessment will be used by Texas Parks and Wildlife in coordination with the Fort Worth Zoo and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop genetically informed management plans for the species. A genetic assessment of the Pecos Pupfish population in Texas will also be critical for informing the upcoming Pecos Pupfish Conservation Agreement and species status assessment. -->
