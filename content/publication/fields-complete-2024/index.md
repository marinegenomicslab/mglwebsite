abstract: The Leuciscidae (minnows, shiners and relatives) is a diverse family of
  freshwater fishes with many species endangered due to anthropogenic stressors. 
  *Notropis oxyrhynchus* and *Notropis buccula* are two shiners found only 
  in the upper Brazos River basin in Texas, USA and listed as endangered due to contracted habitat. The
  complete mitochondrial genome was sequenced for two vouchered specimens for each
  species; Notropis oxyrhynchus having a total mitogenome length of 16,711 bp and
  N. buccula having a total mitogenome length 16685â€“16686 bp, with both including
  13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Phylogenetic
  analysis supports previous hypotheses regarding placement of these species.
