abstract: Identiﬁcation of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is
  problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently,
  species-speciﬁc management of smoothhound shark resources is difﬁcult when multiple
  species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identiﬁcation and distribution
  of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using
  sequences of mitochondrial DNA, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data.
  Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded ND-2 sequences
  and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three
  genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the
  Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished
  each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons
  with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were
  identiﬁed as Smooth Dogﬁsh Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi,
  and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound
  sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic
  data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests
  of species-speciﬁc means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude,
  and month) at capture indicated signiﬁcant differences among the three species with
  respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogﬁsh is found in deeper waters
  than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow
  waters. A diagnostic key for the ﬁeld identiﬁcation of adult specimens of each species
  is provided.
