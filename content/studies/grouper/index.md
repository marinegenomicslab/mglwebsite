Yellowmouth grouper, Mycteroperca interstitialis, and scamp, Mycteroperca phenax, are  similar in physical appearance, leading to high rates of misidentification. Without proper species identification, understanding species-specific landings and life history becomes a challenge. To improve species identification, next generation sequencing techniques are being employed to resolve genetic differences between the species. These data will be used to design a diagnostic molecular panel to differentiate between scamp and yellowmouth grouper utilizing tissue samples collected by “fisheries dependent” and "fisheries-independent” sampling. In additional to finding species specific genetic markers, these data will provide tools for assessments of genetic population structure for both species throughout the western North Atlantic.
