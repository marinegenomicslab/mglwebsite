abstract: The presence of cryptic species can hinder effective conservation planning
  and implementation, as has been the case for speciose groups of freshwater fishes
  that are difficult to differentiate due to conserved morphologies. The West Texas
  shiner <i>Notropis megalops</i> and the Texas shiner <i>Notropis amabilis</i> are a cryptic pair
  of leuciscids (minnows) that co-occur in spring-fed tributaries of the Rio Grande
  in Texas and Mexico. Both <i>N. megalops</i> and <i>N. amabilis</i> are listed as Species of Greatest
  Conservation Need by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. <i>Notropis amabilis</i>
  is widespread and listed as apparently secure by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
  whereas <i>N. megalops</i> has a very limited distribution and has not been ranked by Texas
  Parks and Wildlife Department because of data deficiency. Morphological differences
  between these species have been described; however, proper identification in situ
  remains problematic. Furthermore, given their range of overlap there is potential
  for hybridization, and limited genetic data have been collected comparing the species.
  Therefore, reduced representation genomic and mitochondrial sequencing data were
  used to reassess the distinctness of the species, screen for hybridization, and
  characterize their relative frequencies throughout their range of overlap. Genomic
  analyses recovered two distinct genetic groups corresponding to the species (F'CT
  = 0.89) with no evidence of admixture or introgression. The species were found to
  co-occur at three sampling locations, two in the Devils River and one in the Pecos,
  but not in equal frequencies. Overall, these results provide data and tools for
  further research on <i>N. megalops</i> needed for accurate conservation policies and management
  practices.
