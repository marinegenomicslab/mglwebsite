 abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have the potential to conserve biodiversity and improve fishery sustainability, but their efficacy depends on sound design and implementation, which requires an understanding of connectivity among reserves and between reserves and fished areas. Most studies of connectivity involving reserves focus on fishes with characteristics atypical for exploited species, making the results less applicable to fisheries management. Here, patterns of genomic diversity were assessed within and among geographic samples of juvenile of silk snapper, Lutjanus vivanus, collected in protected and fished areas on the western coast of Puerto Rico. The results indicate significant variation in spatiotemporal genetic recruitment patterns, with the two MPAs located off the shelf having partially decoupled recruitment processes from sites on the shelf. Spatial autocorrelation was found at distances less than 20 km within years, but the degree and pattern of spatial structure differed across years, suggesting that recruitment along the west coast of Puerto Rico originates from semi-independent units of spawners whose contribution varies in space and time. The results suggest that while MPAs may work to supplement fisheries where recruitment is spatiotemporally predictable, in species for which adult contribution is variable in space and time, other management strategies should be explored as well.},
