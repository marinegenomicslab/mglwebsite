 abstract = {Colonization of the New World by marine taxa has been hypothesized to have occurred through the Tethys Sea or by crossing the East Pacific Barrier. To better understand patterns and timing of diversification, geological events can be coupled with time calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses to infer major drivers of diversification. Phylogenetic relationships among members of Sphoeroides, a genus of four toothed pufferfishes (Tetraodontiformes: Tetraodontidae) which are found nearly exclusively in the New World (eastern Pacific and western Atlantic), were reconstructed using sequences from ultra-conserved DNA elements, nuclear markers with clear homology among many vertebrate taxa. Hypotheses derived from concatenated maximum-likelihood and species tree summary methods support a paraphyletic Sphoeroides, with Colomesus deeply nested within the genus. Analyses also revealed S. pachygaster, a pelagic species with a cosmopolitan distribution, as the sister taxon to the remainder of Sphoeroides and recovered distinct lineages within S. pachygaster, indicating that this cosmopolitan species may represent a species complex. Ancestral range reconstruction may suggest the genus colonized the New World through the eastern Pacific before diversifying in the western Atlantic, though date estimates for these events are uncertain due to the lack of reliable fossil record for the genus.},
