abstract: The scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and its cryptic congener, Carolina
  hammerhead (S. gilberti), are sympatrically distributed in the western North Atlantic
  Ocean. Because the species are indistinguishable based on external morphology, little
  research focused on Carolina hammerheads exists. In this study, the distribution
  of Carolina hammerheads in waters of the United States off the east coast (U.S.
  Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was examined and their abundance relative to
  scalloped hammerheads assessed by genetically identifying 1231 individuals using
  diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both species were found in the U.S.
  Atlantic, where 27 % of individuals were Carolina hammerheads, but only scalloped
  hammerheads were identified in the Gulf. In Bulls Bay, SC, a well-known hammerhead
  nursery, assessment of relative abundance from May to September showed scalloped
  hammerheads were more abundant May-June and Carolina hammerheads more abundant July-September.
  Results of this study suggest Carolina hammerheads have a spatially limited distribution
  in the western North Atlantic and highlight the importance of Bulls Bay as a nursery
  for the species. In addition, the results suggest Carolina hammerheads may comprise
  a non-trivial proportion of what is considered the U.S. Atlantic scalloped hammerhead
  stock and should be considered in future decisions regarding management of the hammerhead
  complex.
