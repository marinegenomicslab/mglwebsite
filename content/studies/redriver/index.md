<!-- The upper Red River basin in the Central lowlands of Oklahoma and Texas, is a unique and dynamic ecosystem within the semiarid Great Plain ecoregion. Streams within this ecoregion are characterized by extreme flood and seasonal drought events, and native fish assemblages are mostly composed of small-bodied, salt-tolerant species, includinge true minnows (family Leuciscidae) and pupfish. During the past five decades, however, flow regime alteration and fragmentation, and land cover modification in the region has resulted in significant changes to the physicochemical conditions of aquatic ecosystems, making native fish species more vulnerable to decline and extirpation. Greater information on the status and changes in fish assemblages within the upper Red River stream will benefit conservation planning and management decisions within the basin. This study is focused on the state threatened Red River pupfish (Cyprinodon rubrofluviatilis), prairie chub (Macrybopsis australis), and the imperiled Red River Shiner (Notropis bairdi). Using next-generation sequencing techniques, this project will be the first conservation genomic survey of these species to assess current standing levels of genetic diversity and whether hybridization between Red River pupfish and sheepshead minnow is occurring and/or has occurred within the Red River basin in Texas. -->
